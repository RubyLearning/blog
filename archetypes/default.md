Make sure to check location of title and date

The entries should be in order:

draft
title
date
author
authorlink

And ensure to change the tags

You are also encouraged to use `categories` in the same style above.
For example, if you would like Satish Talim to be in the categories this
will help readers pull up everything written by that person.

Notice the header level is at 2 above, header level 1 is reserved for
the title of the post, and should not be in this file, other than in the
top matter.

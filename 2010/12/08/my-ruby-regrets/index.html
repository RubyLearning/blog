<p>This guest post is by <strong>Jeff Langr</strong>, who has developed software for
thirty years, mastering many other languages (including Smalltalk, C++,
Java, and currently C#), but just not Ruby and Python… yet. (Ever?) He
owns the consulting and training company <a href="http://langrsoft.com/">Langr Software
Solutions</a>, and codes full-time as an employee of
GeoLearning. Jeff is the author of close to a hundred articles on
software development and three books, including Agile Java and the
very-soon-to-be-published Pragmatic Programmers “book,” <a href="http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/">Agile in a
Flash</a>.</p>

Ruby guru? Hardly. Even though I first “learned” Ruby about nine years
ago, perpetual Ruby newbie is a far more correct term. In those nine
years, I’ve coded here and there on a number of throwaway scripts. For
each separate effort, I would get past novice struggles to the point
where I felt reasonably comfortable with the language. But just as I
started to enjoy high levels of productivity, the job was done and it
was back to “enterprisey” Java coding. Months later, sometimes more than
a dozen, I’d work another Ruby script. The cycle would start again at a
slightly higher proficiency level than the last time I started. My
feeble brain would struggle to recall any remnants of my Ruby memory.
It’s impossible to become a guru this way!</p>

<p>I’m once again working on a side effort in Ruby, pairing with a few
other developers to build a testing framework. It’s intended for
inbetweeners (my newly coined term for QA people who are willing to get
a little technical) to easily put together Watir-based tests. As usual,
it’s a small effort, a few days at most. As usual, we (me and my pair
partners) decided to just “hack at it.” Never mind adhering to good OO
design concepts, and never mind test-driving the code. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s a small effort that should stay small over the long haul.</li>
<li>we’re (re)learning Ruby, which means we’re experimenting in irb and
pasting over code that appears to work.</li>
<li>it’s a test tool itself. Do we really need to write tests for a test
tool?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d also paired to develop a couple comparably scoped (that is, small)
Python scripts in the earlier few months. For similar reasons, we
eschewed test-driven development (TDD) and good OO design on those
efforts too.</p>

<p>Fortunately, our constant companion Humility is one of the best
teachers. It doesn’t take long to generate legacy code (code without
tests) to the point of regret. In the case of my three most recent
scripting efforts, the point of regret was somewhere after a half day of
code cranking. What happened? Looking more closely at our three
arguments for hacking it out, we can easily find flaws.</p>

<p>We quickly slammed out a couple hundred lines of Ruby code. Small, yes,
but we quickly found ourselves often unsure about what code was where,
and we knew that we had a good amount of unnecessary duplication. But
our only verification mechanism was to manually run the test framework
against the handful of scripts that it drove–a cycle that took about 90
seconds. We couldn’t make the rapid, ten-second changes that we wanted
to–no one wants to wait more than a minute to verify every two-line code
change.</p>

<p>As far as the learning Ruby part, we know that there’s a Ruby way to
express code, but our novice Ruby brains tend to code it a little more
familiarly first. Without unit tests, we’ve been a lot slower to
transform the ugly procedural-isms into tight Ruby-way constructs. Unit
tests are great for letting you slap together a method’s implementation,
and then safely play with improving its expressiveness.</p>

<p>From the design standpoint, it’s a little more work to create proper
classes, but inevitably we found that the lack of good design just made
for crappier code and more duplication. We also found that mixins, while
very beneficial, can create some interesting challenges and confusion if
you’re not careful with them. Moving to a more OO solution simplified
our codebase and gave us more flexibility.</p>

<p>We quickly wished we had built more tests. As we got more frustrated
with dumb mistakes that took a while to pin down, we started building
some TAD (test-after development) tests. At least these tests let us put
a stake in the ground, but it’s unlikely that we’ll have the time to go
back and completely cover the code. Had we started with TDD, we would
have avoided getting bogged down in the defects. We also would have been
able to keep the code base small, and exhibiting minimal duplication and
confusion.</p>

<p>I didn’t do things the right way the past three times I’ve built small
scripts. But next time I code in Ruby–no doubt enough months away that
I’ll have forgotten much of what I re-learned–I hope my feeble brain
won’t have forgotten, once again, this important lesson. Don’t wait to
test-drive, and don’t hack just because you can.</p>

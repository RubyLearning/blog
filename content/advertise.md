**Advertising / Sponsorship**

RubyLearning.org accepts advertising enquiries, although we like to
handle advertising delicately to keep up a high standard.<!--more--> Contact Satish
Talim at **satish [at] rubylearning [dot] org** to discuss.

**125×125 Banner** ad opportunities (that appear on all pages of the
blog) are available at **US\$ 100** on a monthly basis, or slightly less
on a more regular basis, dependent on availability and commitment. If
you wish to support RubyLearning.org in a more indirect way (as a way of
saying “thanks”), please buy a copy of the [Ruby Study
Notes](/web/20130807020030/http://book.rubylearning.org/) and / or the
[Guide to JRuby](/web/20130807020030/http://jruby.rubylearning.org/) for
yourself or to give to someone else who might like to learn how to
program.

“**Post footer**” sponsorships are also available at **US\$ 40 each**
(or less in bulk) on the RubyLearning blog. This gets your message into
the footer of a post, and it’ll stay on that post for the long-term. The
added advantage of this technique is that all feed subscribers will see
the message in the post, so it’s a great way to target regular
subscribers.

For statistical data and/or any questions you may have, please contact
me at **satish [at] rubylearning [dot] org**.

Here is what **Sandra Randall (Butler)**, a participant who just
graduated, has to say – “You kindly offered me the opportunity to join
your Ruby course. I'm new to development and found the course, even
though basic for programmers, a little tricky for me. I managed to
complete all of the assessments and really learnt a lot. Thank you very
much for the opportunity. It has really given me the push I needed to
learn Ruby and I'm currently treading my way through both the pickaxe
and Agile Development books and enjoying it. I've recently been offered
a position as a Junior Systems Developer at a local Software house in
South Africa – all thanks to the push you gave me which gave me the
motivation and drive to get going.”

## What's Ruby?

![Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/images/rubylogo.png "License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/")

According to
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) – “Ruby is
a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
and productivity. Ruby's elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to
write.”

**Yukihiro Matsumoto**, the creator of Ruby, in **[an
interview](http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html)**
says -

> I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They
> don't want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel
> natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and
> concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use
> Ruby.

## What Will I Learn?

In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the [essential features
of Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html) that you
will end up using every day. You will also be introduced to Git, GitHub,
HTTP concepts, RubyGems, Rack and Heroku.

## Some Highlights

### RubyLearning’s IRC Channel

Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC
(irc.freenode.net) channel (\#rubylearning.org) for both technical and
non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions
on Ruby with the mentors.

### Google Hangouts

There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts
where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is
often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general
environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment
that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively
here.

### Git Repositories

Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git
and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students
that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record
your progress while learning Ruby.

### eBook

The course is based on the **The Ultimate Guide to Ruby Programming**
eBook. This book is [priced at US \$
9.95](http://book.rubylearning.org/). However, the [Kindle
edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062X2I68/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0062X2I68&linkCode=as2&tag=satishtalimsw-20)
of the eBook is available for US\$ 6.

### Challenges and Side Tracks

This is course material not found in the RubyLearning Study Notes nor in
the E-Book! Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding
challenge in the mix, right for the level we are at. We have been known
to give out a prize or two for the 'best' solution.

## Who's It For?

**A *beginner* with some knowledge of programming.**

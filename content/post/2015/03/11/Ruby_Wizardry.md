# Ruby Wizardry - A Book Review

This book is written by Eric Weinstein, published by "no starch
press" and it is an introduction to programming for kids.<!--more-->

It really is a whimsical story, about a kingdom in some trouble because
of some mischievous hooligans and how this kingdom is saved by, well,
you will have to read it to see.

I had problems with reviewing this book, as I showed it to a young
teenager, and I was not able to keep my hands on the book for any
extended period of time.  The book was carried everywhere, and I simply
had to wait for it to find its way back on the table so I could grab it.

Fortunately, they were off to grandma's house this weekend and I finally
got to spend some time with it, and now I see why they are fascinated
with the book.

The story is fun, the code examples are relevant to the story, and Eric
does not hide the documentation from you, occasionally pointing to the
official documentation for more information.  But he doesn't push it on
the reader, so they are welcome to explore and enjoy the book.  In fact,
at the end of the story, the excitement of having done all of this
journey is celebrated, and additional references are presented right
there to continue this journey with other resources.  There is no, "OK,
what can I do now?  Because that was fun!"  You have the additional
steps laid out.  But it is up to you to choose your direction.

He has a coding style that he adheres to throughout the book, this makes
the learning simpler as you aren't questioning why things have changed.
He also encourages using the Interactive Ruby (IRB) tool for exploring,
as well as writing the programs in the files that you can run as well.

The progression is simple, the 'what comes first' obstacle is taken care
of early, so you have the IRB tool and the code that you write taken
care of up front.  How to manage and play with your code interactively,
how to explore Ruby, and about two thirds of the way through the story
you find out how to require the files you write into your IRB session.
Overall, a great basis for continued progress as a programmer.

As you journey through the book, you will have progressively done
increasingly "hard" things, but I don't think you will really notice it.
You will have created interactive programs, will have manipulated files,
will have written a 'web app'.

One thing that I was very happy to find in this book after the first
Table of Contents is the "Contents in Detail" section.  Finding the
review points in this book is now extremely easy, and if you need to
review something, you can easily find the things you are looking for.

I was looking forward to reviewing this book, and now I am looking forward
to the time when that young teenager comes up to me and says "Hey, you
could write that this way!"  And that time is coming up soon.

Thank you Eric for a wonderful story, and this book will let kids
realize that they can do it! Just like Byte, Compute, Antic, ROM,
Antic magazines, I can see this book mentioned years to come as
this generation reminisces about how they learned to program.

  <p class="update">
    Here is what <b>Sandra Randall (Butler)</b>, a participant who just graduated, has to say &#8211; &#8220;You kindly offered me the opportunity to join your Ruby course. I'm new to development and found the course, even though basic for programmers, a little tricky for me. I managed to complete all of the assessments and really learnt a lot. Thank you very much for the opportunity. It has really given me the push I needed to learn Ruby and I'm currently treading my way through both the pickaxe and Agile Development books and enjoying it. I've recently been offered a position as a Junior Systems Developer at a local Software house in South Africa &#8211; all thanks to the push you gave me which gave me the motivation and drive to get going.&#8221;

  <h3>
    What's Ruby?

  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/</a> &#8211; &#8220;Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Ruby's elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to write.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Yukihiro Matsumoto</b>, the creator of Ruby, in <b><a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">an interview</a></b> says -
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They don't want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    What Will I Learn?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html">essential features of Ruby</a> that you will end up using every day. You will also be introduced to Git, GitHub, HTTP concepts, RubyGems, Rack and Heroku.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Some Highlights
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    RubyLearning’s IRC Channel
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with the mentors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Google Hangouts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively here.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Git Repositories
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record your progress while learning Ruby.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    eBook
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    The course is based on the <strong>The Ultimate Guide to Ruby Programming</strong> eBook. This book is <a href="http://book.rubylearning.org/">priced at US $ 9.95</a>. However, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062X2I68/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=B0062X2I68&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=satishtalimsw-20">Kindle edition</a> of the eBook is available for US$ 6.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Challenges and Side Tracks
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    This is course material not found in the RubyLearning Study Notes nor in the E-Book! Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding challenge in the mix, right for the level we are at. We have been known to give out a prize or two for the 'best' solution.

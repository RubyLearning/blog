I got this book a while ago, and of course it is available online as well.  And
it seems like it might be an easy book to review, because it is, what I would
call, a “Pattern Book”.

It is an instructional book, it is teaching you the “hard way”, because you
really need to follow along, it builds up from the basics and gets you to a
good place to continue to learn from.  And it covers a lot.

But it also has a lot of areas to review because of this.  And I went through
every exercise.

One of the things that was obvious is that he wrote this while being immersed
in another language.  There are hints of it throughout and that is not a bad
thing.  One problem area, which is not going to be a show stopper, but a
problem area nonetheless, is his explanation about the triple equals in Ruby.
There is no such thing, but he uses it from the time he introduces it and
through the book.  It is little things like this that can shake a new student
in the language, if they even spot it.

This book is patterned from his prior “Learn The Hard Way” books, and follows
along with the theme, which is helpful.  I will be reading more of his books,
as once you now the format of one, you can know what to expect from the others.
The pace is good for a beginner programmer, and I am going through this with my
son who is starting to learn to program.

There are other areas that are difficult though, where he references things
that are not used, but addresses them in the “Questions” section.

There are things that are initially overlooked, using string interpolation eary
on (Exercise 2) but not explaining what it does.  Why does the math happen in “
3 + 2 #{3 + 2}” inside the brackets?

    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Welcome Felipe and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Felipe>></strong> Thanks Satish for the opportunity. Well, about me&#8230; I&#8217;m a Brazilian guy, a web developer and a Mac user. I&#8217;m 22 years old and I started to program at school, since I was 16. Since then, programming has become my life and I can&#8217;t imagine myself doing any other thing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How did you get involved with Ruby programming?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Felipe>></strong> I discovered Ruby through Rails on a well-known website by Brazilians: iMasters. I was just amazed as it was so easy to understand the Ruby code and I could solve the problems in a very simple way. This got me very motivated and I became more interested in the subject. At that time, I was working with ASP and I was deciding whether to learn Java or .NET. By then, I had realized that Ruby was simpler and I decided to learn it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Felipe>></strong> One of the things that caught my attention was the fact that Ruby is an extremely dynamic language. The way I can open classes and add my own methods is one of the features I like most. Creating DSLs was something I had never seen before and which I found very interesting. These are some of the features I remember at the moment, although I like almost everything in the language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Felipe>></strong> Despite knowing Ruby for almost two years, I had never written more than 50 lines of code. I had not found a project that motivated me to practice. However the <strong>RPCFN</strong> aroused me! Also, I enjoyed the challenge very much. I recommend everybody to take part in the <strong>RPCFN</strong>. Even if you know the language, there is always something new to learn. I intend to participate in all the forthcoming challenges.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> What are your future plans?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Felipe>></strong> I want to study Ruby and Rails deeper, and also learn other languages (Python and Erlang are already on my list). In the short ter, I intend to share whatever I learn about Ruby and about programming in general; perhaps starting my own blog or something else.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><em>Thank you Felipe. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Felipe would be glad to answer.</em></span>

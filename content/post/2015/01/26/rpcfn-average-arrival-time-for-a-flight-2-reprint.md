    About Chris Strom
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="Chris Strom" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/chris_strom.jpg" alt="Chris Strom" />Chris Strom (<a href="http://twitter.com/eee_c">twitter</a> / <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/">blog</a>) in his day job, is the Director of Software Engineering for mdlogix, a small company in Baltimore, Maryland. They develop software that manages clinical research trials and associated data. They primarily code with Ruby on Rails. His background is in web development, mostly in Perl until ~2005 when he made the switch to Ruby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Chris has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>RPCFN is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language. RPCFN provides a fabulous forum for using Ruby in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Ruby well, as each fortnight the best solution to a challenge is chosen. RPCFN is a wonderful introduction to the Ruby language and to the Ruby community. Welcome newbies!</em>
    </p>

    The Ruby Challenge
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <img class="alignright" src='http://rubylearning.com/images/rubypc.jpg' style="border: 0px none ;" alt="RPCFN" title="Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You owe a big favor and have agreed to pick up a friend at the airport every Friday night. The airline on which your friend flies is cheap, but terrible with reporting delays and departure/arrival times. You soon realize that the 10pm flight is never on time and is usually late by more than an hour. If the plane has arrived at 11:15pm, 12:03am, 11:30pm, 11:23pm and 11:48pm, what is the average arrival time?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Does the solution still work if your friend changes to a flight arriving 6 hours later? What about 12 hours later?
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Program Output
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    The output should look something like this when run from the console:
  </p>
  
  <pre>>> average_time_of_day(["11:51pm", "11:56pm", "12:01am", "12:06am", "12:11am"])
=> "12:01am"

>> average_time_of_day(["6:41am", "6:51am", "7:01am"])
=> "6:51am"
</pre>
  
  <h4>
    Hint
  </h4>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your digital ways will not help you, time of day is cyclical.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may need to use the <b>Math</b> and <b>Time</b> classes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <b>Requirements</b>: This has to be a pure Ruby script, using only the Ruby Standard Libraries (meaning, no external Gems). You <b>do not</b> need to build a gem for this. Pure Ruby code is all that is needed.
  </p>

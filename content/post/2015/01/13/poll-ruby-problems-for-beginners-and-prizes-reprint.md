  <h3>
    Poll: Ruby Problems for Beginners and Prizes
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">M</span>any RubyLearning participants wrote in asking RubyLearning to start a weekly post containing a problem to be solved using Ruby. A problem will be posted here every week / fortnight and anyone is free to offer their solution (the solution should be clear-cut, follow Ruby conventions and still be easy to understand) as a comment to the blog post. A small panel will evaluate the solutions received and decide the best amongst them all. The person with the best solution will be awarded a token prize which could be a <a href="http://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a> or a <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts">Pragmatic</a> screencast or something equivalent. Maybe some sponsors could chip in with some prizes!

    RubyLearning is open to this idea and will start the same provided there is a good response to this. There&#8217;s a single question poll below which please answer and <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;">what&#8217;s more important is to post your thoughts, suggestions etc. as comments to this blog post</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We do have the <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a>, a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers. What&#8217;s also needed is something for programmers starting off with Ruby. Maybe RubyLearning could provide this.

  <p class="note">
    <strong><span style="color:red;">Update:</span></strong> Thank you for the over-whelming response to the poll. The poll is now closed. As the poll results suggest, RubyLearning is going ahead and starting off the &#8220;Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)&#8221; from Friday, 25th Sept. 2009. We are also getting a very positive response from many Ruby Gurus and Sponsors. Work on the <b><a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/ruby-programming-challenge-faq/">RPCFN FAQ</a></b> is underway. In the meantime, we still look forward to your response(s) and thoughts, suggestions (thoughts on the nature of the Ruby problem to be asked, evaluation criteria etc.) as comments below.

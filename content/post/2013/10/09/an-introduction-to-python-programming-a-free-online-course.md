  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">Y</span>ou should learn a programming language every year, as recommended by <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>. By learning a new language, you&#8217;ll broaden your perspective of programming. In 2010 we brought to you <code>Clojure</code>, last month we offered you <code>Go</code> and now we offer you a <b>free introductory course on Python programming</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You will learn Python programming along with RubyLearning&#8217;s mentors Anders Persson, Satish Talim and Victor Goff. Registrations have already started. Are you there?

    What&#8217;s Python?
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" alt="Python" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/python-logo.gif" title="Python" /> <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb.html">Python</a> is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python&#8217;s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    <span class="drop_cap">R</span>egistrations are now open for RubyLearning&#8217;s popular &#8220;Pay if you like&#8221; online Git and GitHub course. This is an introductory but an intensive, online course for <em>beginners</em>. Here you&#8217;ll learn the essential features of both Git and GitHub that you&#8217;ll end up using every day.

  <h3>
    What&#8217;s Git and GitHub?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Git</strong> is an open source version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency, but just as well suited for small personal repositories (collection of resources that can be accessed to retrieve information); it is especially popular in the open source community. With <strong>GitHub</strong> you can host your public and private projects there and use it to collaborate on projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ruby Master, <strong>Josh Susser</strong><sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-8025-1' id='fnref-8025-1'>1</a></sup> in an interview with RubyLearning said:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      First off, get an account on GitHub. (If you haven&#8217;t learned git yet, get going on that too &#8211; it&#8217;s the future for open source SCM.) Then do some exploring around the various projects and see where you think you can jump in and contribute something. Pick a project that is currently under development and has an active community. You&#8217;ll have enough going on that you don&#8217;t want to be championing a project just yet.
    </p>

  <h3>
    Mentors
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://satishtalim.com/">Satish Talim</a> and Victor Goff III from the RubyLearning team.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Some Highlights
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    RubyLearning’s IRC Channel
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with the mentors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Google Hangouts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively here.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Git Repositories
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record your progress while learning Ruby.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Mentors
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://satishtalim.com/">Satish Talim</a> and Victor Goff III from the RubyLearning team.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Some Highlights
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    RubyLearning’s IRC Channel
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with the mentors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Google Hangouts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively here.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Git Repositories
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record your progress while learning Ruby.
  </p>

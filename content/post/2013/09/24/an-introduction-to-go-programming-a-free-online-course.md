    <img class="alignleft" alt="Go" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/go.png" title="Go Mascot" /> <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> is an open source programming environment that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go has the feel of a dynamic language like Ruby or Python, but has the performance and safety of languages like C or Java. It is a completely open-source language, distributed with a BSD license, so it can be used by everybody even for commercial purposes without a fee, and it can even be changed by others.

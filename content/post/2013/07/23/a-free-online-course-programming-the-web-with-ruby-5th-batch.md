Registrations are now open for RubyLearning’s “**Pay if you like**“,
online course on “**Programming the Web with Ruby**“. **The first batch
had over 2000 participants**. Web-based applications offer many
advantages, such as instant access, automatic upgrades, and<!--more-->
opportunities for collaboration on a massive scale. However, creating
Web applications requires different approaches than traditional
applications and involves the integration of numerous technologies. The
course topics would hopefully help those that **have some knowledge of
Ruby programming** to get started with web programming (*this does not
cover Ruby on Rails*).

## Who’s It For?

**Anyone with some knowledge of Ruby programming**.

## Dates

The course starts on **Saturday, 17th August 2013** and runs for 2
weeks.

## Is the course really free?

A lot of effort and time goes into building such a course and we would
really love that you pay at least **US\$ 15** for the course. Since this
is a “**Pay if you Like**” course, you are under no obligation to pay
and hence the course would be free for you.

**For those who contribute US\$ 15, we shall email them a copy of the
book (.pdf) “[Programming the Web with
Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/blog/programming-the-web-with-ruby-ebook/)”
– the course is based on this book**.

## How do I register and pay the course fees?

-   First, [create an
    account](http://rubylearning.org/classes/login/index.php) on the
    site and then pay the fees of US\$ 15 by clicking on the PayPal
    button
    [![Paypal](http://rubylearning.com/images/paypal_ruby.gif)](http://rubylearning.org/classes/enrol/index.php?id=29)
-   After payment of the fees please send us your name to **satish [at]
    rubylearning [dot] org** so that we can send you the eBook, which

## Mentors

## RubyLearning’s IRC Channel

Mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net)
channel (\#RubyLearning.org) for both technical and non-technical
discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with
the mentors.

Here are some details on how the course works:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Just to set the expectations correctly, there is no real-time
‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some extra
    notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class reading material
    at a convenient time of your choice – the dates mentioned are just
    for your guideline. While reading, please make a note of all your
    doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments about the
    lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post these on the
    forum **under the relevant lesson**. There could be some questions
    that relate to something that has not been mentioned or discussed by
    the mentors thus far; you could post the same too. Please remember
    that with every post, do mention the operating system of your
    computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that day’s session.
-   There could be exercises every day. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas among
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. Please be aware that these messages are considered noises
    by people subscribed to the forum.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  Most of the days, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help reinforce what you have just learned.
2.  Some days may have some extra assignments / food for thought
    articles / programs.
3.  **Above all, do take part in the relevant forums. Past participants
    have confirmed that they learned the best by active participation.**

### Some Commonly Asked Questions

-   **Qs.** Is there any specific time when I need to be online?\
    **Ans.** No. You need not be online at a specific time of the day.
-   **Qs.** Is it important for me to take part in the course forums?\
    **Ans.** YES. You must Participate in the forum(s) for asking and
    answering questions or starting discussions. Share knowledge, and
    exchange ideas among yourselves (participants) during the course
    period. Participants are strongly encouraged to post technical
    questions, interesting articles, tools, sample programs or anything
    that is relevant to the class / lesson. Past participants will
    confirm that they learned the best by active participation.
-   **Qs.** How much time do I need to spend online for a course, in a
    day?\
    **Ans.** This will vary from person to person. All depends upon your
    comfort level and the amount of time you want to spend on a
    particular lesson or task.
-   **Qs.** Is there any specific set time for feedback (e.g., any
    mentor responds to me within 24 hours?)\
    **Ans.** Normally somebody should answer your query / question
    within 24 hours.
-   **Qs.** What happens if nobody answers my questions / queries?\
    **Ans.** Normally, that will not happen. In case you feel that your
    question / query is not answered, then please post the same in the
    thread – “Any UnAnswered Questions / Queries”.
-   **Qs.** What happens to the class (or forums) after a course is
    over? Can you keep it open for a few more days so that students can
    complete and discuss too?\
    **Ans.** The course and its forum is open for a month after the last
    day of the course.

Remember, the idea is to have fun learning Ruby.

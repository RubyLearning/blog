  <h2>
    Programming the Web with Ruby
  </h2>
  
  <p class="update">
    <span class="drop_cap">R</span>egistrations are now open for RubyLearning&#8217;s &#8220;<b>Pay if you like</b>&#8220;, online course on &#8220;<strong>Programming the Web with Ruby</strong>&#8220;. <b>The first batch had over 2000 participants</b>. Web-based applications offer many advantages, such as instant access, automatic upgrades, and opportunities for collaboration on a massive scale. However, creating Web applications requires different approaches than traditional applications and involves the integration of numerous technologies. The course topics would hopefully help those that <b>have some knowledge of Ruby programming</b> to get started with web programming (<em>this does not cover Ruby on Rails</em>).
  </p>

    Is the course really free?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A lot of effort and time goes into building such a course and we would really love that you pay at least <b>US$ 15</b> for the course. Since this is a &#8220;<b>Pay if you Like</b>&#8221; course, you are under no obligation to pay and hence the course would be free for you.

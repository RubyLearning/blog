  <h3>
    A New Ruby Metaprogramming Course
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>On February 24, 2013, <em>Ruby comes of age</em> and RubyLearning celebrates Ruby&#8217;s 20th birthday by offering you this &#8220;Free&#8221; course. 
    
    <p>
      <em>Happy Birthday Ruby!</em></strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After the huge success of the first seven <strong>Ruby Metaprogramming</strong> batches, RubyLearning now announces the eight batch.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Course dates
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The online course starts on <strong>Sunday 24th Feb. 2013</strong>. It&#8217;s a 9 day course.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      What&#8217;s Ruby Metaprogramming?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Paolo Perrotta has this to say:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As a Ruby programmer, you already know how much fun it is. Now see how to unleash its power, digging under the surface and exploring the language&#8217;s most advanced features: a collection of techniques and tricks known as <em>metaprogramming</em>. Once the domain of expert Rubyists, metaprogramming is now accessible to programmers of all levels &#8211; from beginner to expert.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      Paolo goes on to say the following in a <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/">recent interview</a>:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I realized that metaprogramming sits at the very heart of the language, and when you understand <em>metaprogramming</em>, that&#8217;s the moment you start &#8220;thinking in Ruby&#8221;.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>
      Who&#8217;s It For?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      You need some background in Ruby programming to make the most out of this course.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Is the course really free?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      A lot of effort and time goes into building such a course and we would really love that you pay at least <b>US$ 10</b> for the course. Since this is a &#8220;<b>Pay if you Want</b>&#8221; course, you are under no obligation to pay anything at all and hence the course would be free for you.

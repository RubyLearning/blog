    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/fyi/blog/2008/02/ruby_turns_15_and_other_import.html">Kathryn Barrett</a> reports that this month marks Rubyâ€™s 15th birthday. Yukihiro â€œMatzâ€ Matsumotoâ€“creator of Ruby confirmed that Ruby was conceptualized and named on Feb. 24, 1993. Mark your calendars. While this doesnâ€™t yet qualify Ruby as an old-timer among programming languages, itâ€™s a good indication that itâ€™s here to stay and probably doesnâ€™t deserve to be called a newcomer any more.

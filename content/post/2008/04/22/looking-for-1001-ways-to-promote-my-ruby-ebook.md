    <a href="http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html" ><img class="alignleft" title="Ruby eBook" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/eBook5.jpg" alt="Ruby eBook" /></a>I am looking for ways to promote my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html">Free Ruby eBook</a>. I have come up with some ideas. Some zany, impractical and okay maybe a bit stupid.. but some are simple, fun and easy to do. Will you help me come up with even more? Any idea is acceptable &#8230;. this is just a <strong><em>fun brainstorming session</em></strong> &#8211; to spread the book as far and as wide as it can go! Leave your comments below (you will have to register to do that&#8230;..which is safe, simple and allows you to make comments for other posts as well).. but if you don&#8217;t want to do that&#8230;. (there are a lot of loops to jump through)&#8230; just send me an Email with your idea. and I will add your comments to the list!

    Okay.. so I leeched a little from Sister Patricia Proctor but hey that&#8217;s just flattery, don&#8217;t you think? Sister Patricia Proctor, author of <em>101 Inspirational Stories of the Power of Prayer</em>, shared 101 ideas for marketing her book with the readers of her blog. Since posting that list, a number of readers have sent her almost 20 more ways &#8212; good ways &#8212; to market her book.

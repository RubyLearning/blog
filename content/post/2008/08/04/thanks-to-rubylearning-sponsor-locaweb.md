  <p>
    It&#8217;s time to thank RubyLearning&#8217;s excellent sponsors!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.asp?utm_campaign=Rails&utm_source=rubylearning&utm_medium=banner">Locaweb</a> is the number 1 hosting company in Brazil, with around 400 employees and 133 thousand clients, hosting more than 220 thousand domains. I am including any news or developments the sponsor has had during July 2008.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Locaweb just opened up the registration website for the greatest Ruby on Rails event in Latin America: <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit"><strong>Rails Summit Latin America</strong></a>. It is only in Brazilian Portuguese right now, but in the next few days they&#8217;ll release the international version so every other member of the Latin America community can register. Keep an eye on Fabio Akita&#8217;s <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/english">blog</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rails already has 2 great events, the US and EU RailsConfs. This event is going to be a milestone for the whole community, completing the roster of big world wide Rails events. <strong>David Heinemeir Hansson</strong> himself will speak through online video &#8211; because he will be in Europe at the time &#8211; but several other international speakers will be there, live, including Chad Fowler, Charles Nutter, Chris Wanstrath, Luis Lavena, Obie Fernandez, and others completing the 14 outstanding names.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There will also be 7 great Brazilian Rails Entrepreneurs like <a href="http://blogblogs.com.br/">Manoel Lemos</a>, <a href="http://www.improveit.com/">Vinicius Teles</a>, <a href="http://fabiokung.com/">Fabio Kung</a> and several others to share their experience, tips and techniques with the audience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They expect to have around 650 attendees. The event will take place on <strong>October 15th and 16th</strong> being 2 full days, with 2 parallel sessions in the afternoon, including a <em>&#8220;Birds of a Feather&#8221;</em> session at the end of the first day, allowing anyone from the community to present whatever they want and socialize.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If this event succeeds, this is going to become an annual event for the whole Latin America community. This event if for you, Railers, beginners or seniors, Ruby or non-Ruby programmers, <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/"><b>Register Now</b></a> and let&#8217;s celebrate together!

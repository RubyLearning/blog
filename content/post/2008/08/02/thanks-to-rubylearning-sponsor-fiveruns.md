  <p>
    It&#8217;s time to thank RubyLearning&#8217;s excellent sponsors!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.fiveruns.com/">FiveRuns</a> is a provider of Rails application (and server) monitoring services. I am including any news or developments the sponsor has had during July 2008. Two things worth mentioning here are:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      They recently introduced <strong>DataFabric</strong> &#8211; a gem they wrote to help with <strong>ActiveRecord</strong>. One of the lingering issues they have had to deal with over the last year in the Manage service was ActiveRecordâ€™s reluctance to talk to more than one database. <strong>DataFabric</strong> extends ActiveRecordâ€™s standard connection handling to provide two features &#8211; application-level sharding and master/slave replication. For all the details read the article &#8211; <a href="http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/7/9/introducing-data_fabric">Introducing DataFabric</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Want to travel to Berlin for free? Then you have one week left to take part on their &#8220;<a href="http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/7/10/run-your-way-to-railsconf-europe">Run Your Way to RailsConf Europe</a>&#8221; Contest. They are giving away two tickets to RailsConf Europe (September 2 -4, 2008) &#8211; airfare, hotel, and conference passes. You only need to try out their TuneUp product which they launched at RailsConf in Portland. So what are you waiting for?

  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">T</span>here have been some heavy discussions at <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">RubyLearning</a> about what all should be covered in an <strong>Advanced Ruby Course</strong>. Many topics have been suggested along with a &#8216;for&#8217; and &#8216;against&#8217; each topic, but nothing concrete has come out. I&#8217;d like the topics to be more relevant to the &#8216;<em>Real World Ruby</em>&#8216; which any programmer with a <a href="http://book.rubylearning.org/">basic knowledge of Ruby</a> could master and use. At our Free Core Ruby Programming Course we cover the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html">following topics</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p class="note">
    <strong>You suggest</strong>: To arrive at this list of 21 topics, I need <strong>YOUR</strong> help. I&#8217;d like you to suggest the topic(s) and remember to mention why the topic(s) you suggest are important.
  </p>

    <strong>The â€˜Rulesâ€™</strong> &#8211; Any feedback, suggestions, dreams or ideas that you have are welcome. While I canâ€™t promise to respond to each comment or put every suggestion into place I make a commitment to you to read anything you have to say.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All that I ask in return is that you be honest, courteous and constructive with your feedback.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RubyLearning is a project that I pour a lot of time and effort into &#8211; as a result sometimes criticism can be a little difficult to hear &#8211; however I think itâ€™s vital to take it all on board if this is to continue to be a valuable resource for would-be Ruby developers wanting to improve their Ruby skills.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So itâ€™s over to you. Feel free to either leave your feedback here as comments or to share them privately with me via my email at <strong>mail [at] satishtalim [dot] com</strong>

    <strong>YOU can make a difference!</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:red;">Update:</span></strong> I do have my own list of 21 topics but I have not posted it here, so that I don&#8217;t influence your thinking.

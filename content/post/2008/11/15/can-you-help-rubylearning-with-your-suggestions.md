  <p class="update">
    We&#8217;re rapidly expanding our course offerings here at RubyLearning, trying to keep up with the enormous and ever-growing interest in <strong>Ruby</strong>. But we need your <b>YOUR</b> help because, as you know, Ruby is a big subject, and we&#8217;d like to be sure to focus in on the areas of most interest to <b>you</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>A Note regarding the courses mentioned in the poll below</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ruby Testing and TDD</strong>: (starting from the concepts of testing in general, Test::Unit and other tools are discussed. RSpec is not discussed. Suited for people trying to code test code.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ruby GUI</strong>: (GUI programming. Which library do you recommend &#8211; Shoes, FXRuby?)
    </li>

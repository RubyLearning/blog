    <strong>The Ruby Study Notes eBook</strong> has been downloaded over 14500 times. For a long time there was a constant request of creating the Ruby Study Notes in print form and finally with the help of Lulu.com, I did it!

    With 1000s of participants at the <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">Free Online Ruby Programming Course</a>, many being from countries where the internet is painfully slow or those who do not have a continuous access to the internet; a printed book is always convenient. The printed book is reasonably priced and I sincerely hope that it becomes an asset to all those just starting to learn the Ruby programming language.

With the number of Rails based projects booming in India, Sunil decided to pass on his Rails experience to would-be Rails enthusiasts by offering a <a href="http://www.traineronrails.com/moodle/">Free Online Introductory ROR Course</a>. This course starts from 12th April 2008 and going by Rails popularity, I am sure 100s would join.

  <p>
    I am helping him set up the course using Moodle software, based on my experience with the same, for my <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">Ruby Programming course</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sunil, my best wishes for the course.

    I am happy to announce that <strong><a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.asp?utm_campaign=Rails&utm_source=rubylearning&utm_medium=banner">Locaweb</a></strong> are now the <em>exclusive sponsors</em> of all the Free Online Ruby Programming Courses (FORPC101) at RubyLearning.

  <p>
    All this has been possible due to the tireless efforts of Rails Guru &#8211; <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/english">Fabio Akita</a>.

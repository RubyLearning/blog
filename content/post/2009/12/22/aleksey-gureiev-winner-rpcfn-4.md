**Satish\>\>** Welcome Aleksey and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Aleksey\>\>** Thanks Satish for the opportunity. I’m a 30 year old
independent contractor married to a great woman. Originally from
Sevastopol, Ukraine, but moved to Melbourne, Australia a week ago. I
came to the Ruby world from Java and low-level C++ with more than 10
years of background in both. Know two dozen programing languages but out
of all of them, Ruby is my “love from the first sight”. I’m with Ruby
for 3 years now and not planning a change, even though I learned a
couple of others since then.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Aleksey\>\>** As an independent contractor, I’m always looking at ways
to extend the horizons and learning a couple of languages or
technologies every year, just to stay on the edge. Ruby was one of these
languages. The only difference is that I switched over to it immediately
and have never looked back again.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Aleksey\>\>**

1.  **Flexibility**. Whether it’s defining DSLs and using them to
    simplify code, or just extending existing classes on the fly through
    the reopening in a way it’s implemented in Ruby turned my world
    upside-down. Dynamic programming plays a huge role in my everyday
    coding.
2.  **Object orientation**. The fact that everything in the Ruby world
    is an object and benefits from this means a lot. Now given that you
    can script without defining classes (as you have to do in Java, for
    example) and still can benefit from OO features is terrific.
3.  **Availability for the web development**. Not exactly the feature,
    but still a great asset. The way Ruby changed web development in
    recent years is hard to put in words. Freelancers like me now can
    deliver more reliable and flexible products, faster than ever.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Aleksey\>\>** Loved it, to say the least. The task was challenging
enough to scratch the head for a nice solution. I would say the
challenges like this teach people to dig for info and come up with
something elegant, off the beaten path solutions. Problem solving and
learning ways to educate yourself is more important than specific
language skills or knowing all the docs by heart.

**Satish\>\>** How is the Ruby and Rails scenario in your country
Ukraine?

**Aleksey\>\>** It’s still building speed there (I’m sorry, I’ve just
left the place). Not sure about the capital area, but on the outskirts
it’s still hard to find anyone working with Ruby. I had a great luck
working with a team of converts who continued working with PHP while
starting to explore Ruby. Watching their reaction as they continued to
explore was just another confirmation that Ruby has the bright future.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Aleksey\>\>** I’m continuing to work with Ruby and specifically with
Ruby on Rails. In my daily work I switched to it entirely and currently
recommending to all my clients. Recently, I’ve been working on an iPhone
native app (Objective-C) that talks to a server back-end. It’s needless
to say that the server side was implemented in RoR with the complete
test suite in no time, great quality and sheer pleasure on both sides.

*Thank you Aleksey. In case you have any queries and/or questions,
kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and
Aleksey would be glad to answer.*

  <p class="alert">
    Today when I logged onto my computer a Calendar notification popped up at me telling me that it has been 4 wonderful years of Ruby programming for me. Time flies when you&#8217;re having fun!
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    So how does one celebrate a Ruby birthday?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Ruby has given a lot to me. It&#8217;s helped me meet some great people, it&#8217;s given me a more global perspective on life and provided my family with a good income (to name just a few benefits).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But I want moreâ€¦.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want others to benefit from my Ruby knowledge. Not just in the information that it provides &#8211; but I would love our collective knowledge of Ruby to become something that changes the lives of people who through circumstances beyond their control are unable to live to their potential.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The result of this is that instead of having a Ruby birthday that is all about me and RubyLearning I want to have one that gives something back.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    How?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Over the next week I have decided to donate US$ 200 to a local charity <a href="http://helpageindia.org/">HelpAge India</a>. This is a charity that I strongly believe in.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p class="note">
    I&#8217;d like to invite you to celebrate with me by considering buying my <a href="http://book.rubylearning.org/">Ruby eBook</a> <b>over the next 7 days</b>. When you buy the Ruby eBook, <b>100% of the sale proceeds will be donated to <a href="http://helpageindia.org/">HelpAge India</a></b>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Why HelpAge?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In a country of 90 million (current estimate) older persons, 33% live below the poverty line, 90% are from the unorganized sector with no social security, and 73% are illiterate and dependent on physical labour.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>HelpAge</strong> reaches out to the underprivileged elderly through its various services in the areas of financial, health and emotional security.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HelpAge depends on donations and legacies to fund its services and activities.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Should you donate?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    If you can&#8217;t afford to give $9.95 for the Ruby eBook then there&#8217;s no pressure to. You can support the project by spreading the news about it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m not sure how many US$ we&#8217;ll raise but hopefully together we can <b>Support-A-Grandparent</b>!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Will YOU join me?</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>Update</b>: This project is now over. Thank you for the overwhelming response. I have donated Rs. 26000-00 to HelpAge India on 6th Jan. 2010.</span>

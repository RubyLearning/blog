Today when I logged onto my computer a Calendar notification popped up
at me telling me that it has been 4 wonderful years of Ruby programming
for me. Time flies when you’re having fun!<!--more-->

## So how does one celebrate a Ruby birthday?

Ruby has given a lot to me. It’s helped me meet some great people, it’s
given me a more global perspective on life and provided my family with a
good income (to name just a few benefits).

But I want more….

I want others to benefit from my Ruby knowledge. Not just in the
information that it provides – but I would love our collective knowledge
of Ruby to become something that changes the lives of people who through
circumstances beyond their control are unable to live to their
potential.

The result of this is that instead of having a Ruby birthday that is all
about me and RubyLearning I want to have one that gives something back.

## How?

Over the next week I have decided to donate US\$ 200 to a local charity
[HelpAge India](http://helpageindia.org/). This is a charity that I
strongly believe in.

I’d like to invite you to celebrate with me by considering buying my
[Ruby eBook](http://book.rubylearning.org/) **over the next 7 days**.
When you buy the Ruby eBook, **100% of the sale proceeds will be donated
to [HelpAge India](http://helpageindia.org/)**.

## Why HelpAge?

In a country of 90 million (current estimate) older persons, 33% live
below the poverty line, 90% are from the unorganized sector with no
social security, and 73% are illiterate and dependent on physical
labour.

**HelpAge** reaches out to the underprivileged elderly through its
various services in the areas of financial, health and emotional
security.

HelpAge depends on donations and legacies to fund its services and
activities.

## Should you donate?

If you can’t afford to give \$9.95 for the Ruby eBook then there’s no
pressure to. You can support the project by spreading the news about it.

I’m not sure how many US\$ we’ll raise but hopefully together we can
**Support-A-Grandparent**!

**Will YOU join me?**

**Update**: This project is now over. Thank you for the overwhelming
response. I have donated Rs. 26000-00 to HelpAge India on 6th Jan. 2010.

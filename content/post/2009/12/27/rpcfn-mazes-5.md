    <img class="alignleft" title="Peter Cooper" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/peter-cooper-125.gif" alt="Peter Cooper" />Peter Cooper (<a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">twitter</a>) is the editor and curator of several Ruby sites including <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">Ruby Inside</a>, <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/">Rails Inside</a>, and <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">RubyFlow</a>. They develop software that manages clinical research trials and associated data. They primarily code with Ruby on Rails. His background is in web development, mostly in Perl until ~2005 when he made the switch to Ruby.

    Peter has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>RPCFN is designed to make you good at turning mental concepts into working Ruby code. If you can do that, the programming world is your oyster, and challenges like those presented with RPCFN are a great first (or second!) step. If I have any advice about how to approach the challenges, remember to keep it fun at all times, and if your solution isn&#8217;t working out, take a few steps back and be prepared to knock over your sandcastle and try a different approach. A common mistake in programming is to keep digging the same hole even deeper rather than finding a better place to dig <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> Try lots of holes instead; Ruby makes it easy.</em>

    The Ruby Challenge
  </h3>

  <h4>
    Introduction
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Mazes are known to have challenged humans from as far back as the 5th century BC. There are many types of maze, but typically you need to find your way from a start point to an end point.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this Ruby challenge, you will need to develop a class that can be used to solve mazes. Mazes will be provided as a string showing a graphical representation of the maze&#8217;s layout. Spaces are navigable, while # (pound) symbols are used to denote walls. In this challenge the letter &#8220;A&#8221; is used to mark the start point, and &#8220;B&#8221; the end point. Here&#8217;s an example of a maze contained within a string:
  </p>
  
  <pre>MAZE1 = %{#####################################
# #   #     #A        #     #       #
# # # # # # ####### # ### # ####### #
# # #   # #         #     # #       #
# ##### # ################# # #######
#     # #       #   #     # #   #   #
##### ##### ### ### # ### # # # # # #
#   #     #   # #   #  B# # # #   # #
# # ##### ##### # # ### # # ####### #
# #     # #   # # #   # # # #       #
# ### ### # # # # ##### # # # ##### #
#   #       #   #       #     #     #
#####################################}
</pre>
  
  <p>
    The prior maze would be loaded into a Maze object like so:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
Maze.new(MAZE1)
</pre>
  
  <h4>
    The Challenge
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There are two parts to the challenge: you can choose to do one or both, depending on your skill level or how much time you have available.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Implement a Maze#solvable? method that returns true/false depending on whether it&#8217;s possible to navigate the maze from point A to point B.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implement a Maze#steps method that returns an integer of the least number of &#8220;steps&#8221; one would have to take within the maze to get from point A to point B. &#8220;Steps&#8221; can only be taken up, down, left or right. No diagonals.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    There are a number of ways to &#8220;solve&#8221; mazes but there&#8217;s a wide scope for you to be as straightforward or as clever as you like with this challenge (tip: I&#8217;d love to see some clever/silly solutions!). Your &#8220;solvable?&#8221; and &#8220;steps&#8221; methods could share algorithms or you might come up with alternate ways to be more efficient in each case. Good luck!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Note</b>: Use the test suite to ensure your code interfaces in the right way. The test suite demonstrates how your class will be called and used.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    The Test Suite
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Your Maze class should be in maze.rb for the following test suite to work <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

  <h4>
    Requirements
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    This has to be a pure Ruby script, using only the Ruby Standard Libraries (meaning, no external Gems). You <b>do not</b> need to build a gem for this. Pure Ruby code is all that is needed.

all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **25 to 27 August 2009**.
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.

**Remember:** Don't wait! You could win a copy of this book and it's
free to join.

The previous book promotions of "Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts", "Rails Test
Prescriptions", "Ruby in Practice", "Head First Rails", "Programming
Ruby 1.9″, "The Well-Grounded Rubyist", "Foundation Rails 2″, "Ruby Best
Practices" and "Ruby on Rails for Microsoft Developers" were a big
success.

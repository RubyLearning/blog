  <h3>
    What&#8217;s Git and GitHub?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Git</strong> is an open source version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency, but just as well suited for small personal repositories (collection of resources that can be accessed to retrieve information); it is especially popular in the open source community. With <strong>GitHub</strong> you can host your public and private projects there and use it to collaborate on projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ruby Master, <strong>Josh Susser</strong><sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1340-1' id='fnref-1340-1'>1</a></sup> in a recent interview with RubyLearning said:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      First off, get an account on GitHub. (If you havenâ€™t learned git yet, get going on that too &#8211; it&#8217;s the future for open source SCM.) Then do some exploring around the various projects and see where you think you can jump in and contribute something. Pick a project that is currently under development and has an active community. You&#8217;ll have enough going on that you don&#8217;t want to be championing a project just yet.
    </p>

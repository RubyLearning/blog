## Git and GitHub: A Free Course

RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, FXRuby, Shoes, Sinatra and
Merb. Since 2005, over 7800 participants spread across 140+ countries
have learned Ruby and other Ruby related timely topics. This has been
possible due to the extensive support provided by the patrons, mentors
and assistant teachers of these courses. RL strives hard to improve the
methodology and course content based on the extensive and critical
feedback we receive. Thanks to **YOU**, the Ruby community, people like
Fabio Akita and companies like Locaweb who make this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

You kept [asking for
it](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/11/15/can-you-help-rubylearning-with-your-suggestions/)
and so here it is – the new introductory, **free**, online course that
helps you get started with **Git and GitHub**.

> Get involved in the Ruby community. Join GitHub

## What’s Git and GitHub?

**Git** is an open source version control system designed to handle very
large projects with speed and efficiency, but just as well suited for
small personal repositories (collection of resources that can be
accessed to retrieve information); it is especially popular in the open
source community. With **GitHub** you can host your public and private
projects there and use it to collaborate on projects.

Ruby Master, **Josh Susser**^[1](#fn-1340-1)^ in a recent interview with
RubyLearning said:

> First off, get an account on GitHub. (If you havenâ€™t learned git
> yet, get going on that too – it’s the future for open source SCM.)
> Then do some exploring around the various projects and see where you
> think you can jump in and contribute something. Pick a project that is
> currently under development and has an active community. You’ll have
> enough going on that you don’t want to be championing a project just
> yet.

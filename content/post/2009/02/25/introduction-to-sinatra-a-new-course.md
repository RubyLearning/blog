> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services

## What’s Sinatra?

Sinatra is a microframework for quickly creating *tiny web-applications*
and *small services* in Ruby. It is not a Model-View-Controller (MVC)
based framework.

Please read – [Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why it
Matters](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html).

RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book “**The
Well-Grounded Rubyist**” by author David Black.<!--more-->

[![The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://rubylearning.com/images/twgrcover.jpg "The Well-Grounded Rubyist")](http://manning.com/black2/)

The general idea of a **book promotion** is that it gives the
participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the
author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book,
all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **9th to 11th June 2009**.
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.

**Remember:** Don’t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it’s
free to join.

The previous book promotions of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts”, “Rails Test
Prescriptions”, “Ruby in Practice” and “Head First Rails” were a big
success.

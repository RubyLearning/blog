      <b>Message from Dave Thomas</b>: <em>Although I know this is supposed to be a book promotion, I&#8217;d like to take to opportunity here to talk about Ruby, too. I love the language, and after more than 10 years still find new things that surprise and delight me. I&#8217;d love to talk with your members about those thingsâ€”about the importance of loving and respecting the tools that you use. I&#8217;d love to talk about Ruby 1.9, and about all the various issues that surround the language. Let&#8217;s make programming fun again!</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>Remember:</b> Don&#8217;t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it&#8217;s free to join</span>.

    The previous book promotions of &#8220;Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts&#8221;, &#8220;Rails Test Prescriptions&#8221; and &#8220;Ruby in Practice&#8221; were a big success.

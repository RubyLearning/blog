## Book Promotion: Programming Ruby 1.9

RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book
“**Programming Ruby 1.9**” by author Dave Thomas.

[![Programming Ruby
1.9](http://rubylearning.com/images/ruby3_180.png "Programming Ruby 1.9")](http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9)

The general idea of a **book promotion** is that it gives the
participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the
author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book;
all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **2nd to 4th June 2009**.
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.
-   **Message from Dave Thomas**: *Although I know this is supposed to
    be a book promotion, I’d like to take to opportunity here to talk
    about Ruby, too. I love the language, and after more than 10 years
    still find new things that surprise and delight me. I’d love to talk
    with your members about those thingsâ€”about the importance of
    loving and respecting the tools that you use. I’d love to talk about
    Ruby 1.9, and about all the various issues that surround the
    language. Let’s make programming fun again!*

**Remember:** Don’t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it’s
free to join.

The previous book promotions of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts”, “Rails Test
Prescriptions” and “Ruby in Practice” were a big success.

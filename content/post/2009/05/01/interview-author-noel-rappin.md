**Satish\>\>** Noel, could you tell us something about yourself – your
background, where you are based?

**Noel\>\>** I work for [Pathfinder Development](http://www.pathf.com/),
a web consulting firm in Chicago, Illinois, as the Vice President of
Rails Practice, which means that I am a technical lead or technical
consultant on our Rails projects in addition to keeping a general eye on
the latest and greatest tools. I’ve been working in web applications for
about ten years, the last few of which have been primarily in Rails.
Before that, I earned a Ph.D. in educational technology from the Georgia
Institute of Technology.

I am the author or co-author of three books, \_Jython Essentials\_,
\_wxPython in Action\_, and [Professional Ruby on
Rails](http://www.pathf.com/showcase/books/professional-ruby-on-rails/).

Prescriptions](http://rubylearning.com/images/cover_thumbnail.png "Rails Test Prescriptions")

**Satish\>\>** Your book “Rails Test Prescriptions” – what is it about?

**Noel\>\>** Ideally, it’s a complete guide to testing your Rails
application, by which I mean both the technical aspects of how the
testing tools work as well as the process by which you can take
advantage of testing to improve your code. The book starts with a
detailed tutorial about how to get started on a new project using a
test-driven development process. Following that, the book has sections
on each of the major components of Rails testing, unit testing,
functional testing, fixtures, and so on. Later sections cover testing
style and tips for better testing, as well as popular third-party tools
like Shoulda, Cucumber, factory tools, and so on.

**Satish\>\>** Who is the book targeted at?

**Noel\>\>** The book assumes some basic knowledge of Rails, but beyond
that, it doesn’t assume any particular knowledge or experience with
testing. I hope, though, that even if you think you know how to test,
you’ll still get value from the discussions of testing style, how to
test in unusual situations, and newer test tools like Cucumber.

**Satish\>\>** Why did you decide to publish the book yourself?

**Noel\>\>** Probably the most important reason is the ability to easily
keep the book up to date over time. Rails tools change so rapidly that
any print book starts to go out of date the second it hits the shelves.
Having a chance to update the book when a new version of a tool is
released will make the book valuable to it’s readers for longer.

I’ve worked with some wonderful people at technical publishers, but the
publishing industry works slowly, and this was a chance to write about a
subject that I was excited about without having to spend six months
convincing a publisher that the topic was worth their time.

**Satish\>\>** What kinds of tests and tools to write these tests, do
you cover in the book?

**Noel\>\>** I start with the basic tools that come with Rails, on the
theory that everybody will have access to them. After that, I try to
cover everything that either seems to have a substantial number of
users, or that I just personally use and like. In the case where there
are multiple tools that do the same thing, I tried to focus on the one
tool that either had the most interesting functionality or the largest
user base. For example, rather than write essentially the same topic
about three different mock object frameworks, I chose to focus on Mocha
due to it’s prominent use by the core Rails team.

**Satish\>\>** Anything else you would like to add?

**Noel\>\>** This book is still very much a work in progress, so in
addition to questions about Rails and testing, I’m very much interested
in what kind of topics I should be including in the book.

*Thank you Noel. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Noel would
be glad to answer.*

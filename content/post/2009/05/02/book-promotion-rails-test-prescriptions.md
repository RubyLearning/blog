    RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book &#8220;<strong>Rails Test Prescriptions</strong>&#8221; by author Noel Rappin.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    The general idea of a <strong>book promotion</strong> is that it gives the participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book; all for free!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the details:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Promotion Period: <strong>12th to 14th May 2009</strong>.

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>Remember:</b> Don&#8217;t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it&#8217;s free to join</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The previous book promotion of &#8220;Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts'&#8221; was a big success.

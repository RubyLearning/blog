RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book “**Rails
Test Prescriptions**” by author Noel Rappin.<!--more-->

[![Rails Test Prescriptions](http://rubylearning.com/images/cover_thumbnail.png "Rails Test Prescriptions")](http://www.railsprescriptions.com/)

The general idea of a **book promotion** is that it gives the
participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the
author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book;
all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **12th to 14th May 2009**.
-   [An interview with the author Noel Rappin](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/05/01/interview-author-noel-rappin/).
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.

**Remember:** Don’t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it’s
free to join.

The previous book promotion of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts'” was a big
success.

RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book “**Head
First Rails**” by author David Griffiths.<!--more-->

[![Head First
Rails](http://rubylearning.com/images/hfrails_180x180.gif "Head First Rails")](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515775/?CMP=ILC-hf1st#top)

The general idea of a **book promotion** is that it gives the
participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the
author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book;
all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **26th to 28th May 2009**.
-   35% discount on the book offered.
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.

**Remember:** Don’t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it’s
free to join.

The previous book promotions of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts” and “Rails
Test Prescriptions” were a big success.

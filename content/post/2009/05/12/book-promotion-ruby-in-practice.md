    The general idea of a <strong>book promotion</strong> is that it gives the participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book; all for free!

    Here are the details:
  </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming can join. It is <strong>FREE</strong>. Join <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35"><b>here</b></a> and use Enrollment key: <b>BPCE101</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can start posting your questions related to the book, immediately.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>Remember:</b> Don&#8217;t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it&#8217;s free to join</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The previous book promotion of &#8220;Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts'&#8221; was a big success.

**Satish\>\>** Jeremy, could you tell us something about yourself – your
background, where you are based?

**Jeremy\>\>** I’m Jeremy McAnally. I’ve been developing software for
about 8 years now, bouncing from VB3 (16-bit, w00t!) to PHP to C\# to
Python to Ruby and beyond working on a really wide array of projects.
I’m currently based in Huntsville, AL.

**Satish\>\>** Assaf Arkin is also a co-author of the book. Tell us
something about him.

**Jeremy\>\>** Assaf has a lot of experience in software, far more than
I do, and experience brings a lot of hard earned wisdom with it.
Throughout the book project it was great to be able to discuss ideas
that I’d learned with someone else who had enough experience to really
tell me whether I’d learned a good lesson or if I had misinterpreted the
situation.

**Satish\>\>** Your book “Ruby in Practice” – what is it about?

**Jeremy\>\>** “**Ruby in Practice**” is a book on using Ruby beyond the
basics — basically, it’s written to answer, “I know Ruby…now what?” It
shows you how to apply Ruby in common business scenarios and what tools
you should use to solve those problems.

**Satish\>\>** Who is the book targeted at?

**Jeremy\>\>** It’s primarily targeted at intermediate developers who
know Ruby. We spend time at the beginning of the book covering more
advanced language topics that your introductory course or book may have
left out, and then quickly move to using those advanced concepts to
discuss solving problems with Ruby.

**Satish\>\>** What’s been your experience with the publisher – Manning
Publications?

**Jeremy\>\>** The team has been great. It’s been a long road from the
book’s initial state, and they’ve been abundantly patient and supportive
along the way.

**Satish\>\>** Your book has many co-authors like Yehuda Katz, David
Black, Gregory Brown, Peter Cooper, and Luke Melia. How was this
experience?

**Jeremy\>\>** Oh, it was fantastic working with these guys. As the book
progressed, Assaf and I realized that we “know” how to use everything
and have used these tools in real projects, but it would bring a much
richer tone and wider range of experiences if we could bring in people
who have used these things even more than us (possibly even specialize
in it) or have actually written the libraries we discuss (such as Greg
Brown and Ruport). After they wrote their chapter, we passed through and
added notes, extensions, and extra sections based on our own knowledge.
I think overall the meshing of their experiences with ours created an
extremely rich discussion of these topics.

**Satish\>\>** Looking back, are there some topics that you now wish
should have been covered or dropped from the book?

**Jeremy\>\>** I really wish we could have used
[handsoap](http://github.com/troelskn/handsoap/tree/master) rather than
soap4r. I know soap4r is the tried and true standard for SOAP in Ruby,
but handsoap looks so much nicer. I also wish that we could have gone
into creating web services a little more using Rack or something, but
perhaps that was outside the scope of the book.

**Satish\>\>** Anything else you would like to add?

**Jeremy\>\>** Thanks for interviewing me.

*Thank you Jeremy. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Jeremy
would be glad to answer.*

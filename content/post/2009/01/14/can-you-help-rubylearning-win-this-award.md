Hollywood has the Oscars. Broadway has the Tonys. **Now Twitter has the

the Brooklyn Internet company [Sawhorse Media](http://sawhorsemedia.com/), aim to honor the best Twitterers of
2008 in categories like **education**, humor, news and
food…[**Reference**: [The New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/from-the-twitterspere-tropies-for-the-best-tweets/).]

## Yes YOU can. How?
**RubyLearning** offers *free* online Ruby programming courses and since
2005, over 6500 participants spread across 140+ countries have learned
Ruby programming. Your vote at the Shorty Awards will help RubyLearning
to continue provide this service to all the corners of the earth,
helping people learn and have fun with Ruby.

## How do you Vote?

-   You need to have an **existing** [Twitter
    account](http://twitter.com/).
-   To vote for **RubyLearning** in the finals, send a tweet similar to
    this: **@shortyawards I vote for @RubyLearning in category
    \#education because…** (*be sure to type a reason after because…, or
    your vote won’t count!* – the total tweet should not exceed 140
    characters).\
    **OR**\
    Use the form on [this
    site](http://shortyawards.com/category/education) (click on
    **Vote!** next to **RubyLearning**). The form will ask you for your
    Twitter username / password / email id registered with Twitter. It’s
    safe to enter your password.
-   The text of the tweet is completely up to you. As long as it
    contains **@shortyawards @RubyLearning \#education reason** you can
    be as creative with the rest as you like.

**Remember**:

-   You actually have to write something. Just submitting the default
    tweet, or a tweet with no reason, doesn’t count.
-   Your votes won’t be counted if your Twitter account is private. Your
    votes must appear publicly.
-   To vote, you have to have been an active Twitter user prior to the
    start of the competition. Votes originating from newly created
    Twitter accounts made specifically for Shorty Awards voting may be
    removed at the judges’ discretion.

## Book Promotion: Ruby on Rails for Microsoft Developers

RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book “**Ruby on
Rails for Microsoft Developers**” by author Antonio Cangiano.

[![Ruby on Rails for Microsoft
Developers](http://rubylearning.com/images/Ruby-on-Rail_square.gif "Ruby on Rails for Microsoft Developers")](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Ruby-on-Rails-for-Microsoft-Developers.productCd-0470374950.html)

The general idea of a **book promotion** is that it gives the
participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact with the
author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of the book,
all for free!

Here are the details:

-   Promotion Period: **14 to 16 July 2009**.
-   Registrations have started. Anyone interested in Ruby programming
    can join. It is **FREE**. Join
    [**here**](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) and
    use Enrollment key: **BPCE101**.
-   You can start posting your questions related to the book,
    immediately.

**Remember:** Don’t wait! You could win a copy of this book and it’s
free to join.

The previous book promotions of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts”, “Rails Test
Prescriptions”, “Ruby in Practice”, “Head First Rails”, “Programming
Ruby 1.9″, “The Well-Grounded Rubyist”, “Foundation Rails 2″ and “Ruby
Best Practices” were a big success.

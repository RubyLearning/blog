Welcome to the **eight** installment on the RL blog, of a mini series –
“**How do I learn and master Sinatra?**” – by top Rubyists using
*Sinatra*. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from
these notable *Sinatra* developers, with the goal of facilitating and
providing answers to the questions Ruby beginners face on *how to learn
and master Sinatra*.

**Satish\>\>** Carlos Gabaldon, could you tell us something about
yourself – your background, where you are based?

![Carlos
Gabaldon](http://www.rubylearning.com/images/Carlos_Gabaldon_125.jpg "Carlos Gabaldon")**Carlos
Gabaldon\>\>** I’m [Carlos Gabaldon](http://carlosgabaldon.com/). I have
been in software development for over 10 years. I am currently working
as a software architect for the Apollo Group, Inc. I am based in
Chandler, AZ. I have experience in multiple languages and platforms: C,
C++, C\#, Java, Small Talk, Lisp, Erlang, Ruby, Objective-C, Python, and
PHP on Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.

**Satish\>\>** Are there any pre-requisites for a person to start
learning Sinatra?

**Carlos\>\>** A basic understanding of Ruby and HTTP are very helpful.
Since Sinatra is essentially a DSL on top of Rack, which is just an
abstraction layer for dealing with HTTP, understanding Ruby’s
implementation of blocks, closures, and hashes will make working with
Sinatra a little more straight forward.

**Satish\>\>** How should one start learning Sinatra?

**Carlos\>\>** The best way to learn is to download the latest version
of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and read the documentation to
get your first app running. The docs are great way to start learning.
After you have gone through all the examples, I suggest building your
sample application, that will allow you to explore all the various
aspects of Sinatra. By building a blog or some type of social web app it
will force you to learn how to do things like authentication,
authorization, session management, and database interaction. Also,
spelunking the [source
code](http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master) on GitHub is a
great way to learn the internals.

> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services

**Satish\>\>** Which area of Sinatra should a beginner pay particular
attention to?

**Carlos\>\>** For a beginner I would suggest focusing on understanding
Routes, Handlers, Views, Helpers, Authentication, and Models. These are
the core things required to build most basic web applications.

**Satish\>\>** Is the official documentation on Sinatra good enough for
a beginner? Are there areas which need improvement or need to be
re-written

**Carlos\>\>** The official docs are great for a beginner to learn
Sinatra. The [Sinatra book](http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html) looks
very promising once it is complete, it just needs more people like
myself contributing to the completion.

**Satish\>\>** Sequel, DataMapper, ActiveRecord – which one would you
recommend to use with Sinatra and why?

**Carlos\>\>** It depends on your background. If you are coming to
Sinatra from the Rails community you will most likely be more
comfortable with ActiveRecord; like wise if you are coming from Merb you
will be more familiar with DataMapper, since it is used pretty heavily
in that community. For basic little web applications I think any of the
above ORM’s are great. I personally really like Sequel and DataMapper
since they give you much more control over your table and object
mappings as well as your custom SQL. ActiveRecord abstracts to much of
the SQL for my tastes which makes optimization of SQL queries very
difficult. If someone plans to build a high performance web site using
Sinatra or any other web framework I would recommend against using any
ORM – you want to have a lot of control over your SQL, you do not want
the join queries being generated by an ORM.

**Satish\>\>** Is an understanding of Rack important while learning
Sinatra? Why? Which area of Rack should one be really comfortable with?

**Carlos\>\>** I do not feel an understanding of Rack is important for
someone learning Sinatra. Once you have a solid understanding of
Sinatra, then learning Rack will help one with building middleware.

**Satish\>\>** How should one hone one’s skills in Sinatra?

**Carlos\>\>** Build a lot of different types of web apps, learn Ruby,
study Sinatra’s source code, and read great sites like yours.

**Satish\>\>** What type of projects should a beginner work on to gain
more expertise in Sinatra?

**Carlos\>\>** Blogs, Community Sites, really anything.

**Satish\>\>** Could you suggest some web services that a Sinatra
beginner could develop himself / herself?

**Carlos\>\>** I would suggest building social integration type services
on top of the Twitter or Facebook api’s. There is a lot of great open
web service api’s out there to some great communities, building services
that can integrate various communities is always cool.

**Satish\>\>** Anything else you would like to add?

**Carlos\>\>** Sinatra is a great Ruby DSL which makes it a lot of fun
to build cool web applications. But this is possible, because Ruby is a
great language for building DSL’s and Rack makes it easy to build web
frameworks. I suggest that mastering Ruby and learning more about Rack
are the next steps after getting comfortable with Sinatra.

*Thank you Carlos. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Carlos
would be glad to answer.*

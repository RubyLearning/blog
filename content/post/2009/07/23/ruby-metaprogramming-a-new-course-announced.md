  <h3>
    What&#8217;s Ruby Metaprogramming?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Paolo Perrotta, author of the book &#8220;<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby">Metaprogramming Ruby</a>&#8221; has this to say:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As a Ruby programmer, you already know how much fun it is. Now see how to unleash its power, digging under the surface and exploring the language&#8217;s most advanced features: a collection of techniques and tricks known as <em>metaprogramming</em>. Once the domain of expert Rubyists, metaprogramming is now accessible to programmers of all levels &#8211; from beginner to expert.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Paolo goes on to say the following in a <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/">recent interview</a>:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I realized that metaprogramming sits at the very heart of the language, and when you understand <em>metaprogramming</em>, that&#8217;s the moment you start &#8220;thinking in Ruby&#8221;.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>

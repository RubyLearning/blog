for more details. Here, in this brief interview, Satish Talim of
RubyLearning talks to Antonio Cangiano.

**Satish\>\>** Antonio, could you tell us something about yourself –
your background, where you are based?

**Antonio\>\>** Sure, Satish. I’m an Italian hacker living in Toronto,
Canada where I work as a Software Engineer and Technical Evangelist for
IBM. Part of the reason why I was hired by IBM was due to my expertise
and passion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails (which I’d been following since
2004).

In 2006 I developed the first version of the adapter that enables
[DB2](http://db2express.com/) to work with ActiveRecord/Rails, and have
since been engaged in many projects that involved Rails and other
dynamic languages and frameworks. I like to think of myself as being a
very curious person who always approach new technologies with an open
mind. My passion for Ruby and other open source tools turns me into the
guy who’s always pushing for an increased level of adoption of these
less common, but exciting technologies within IBM and the enterprise
world.

Lately, in my limited spare time, I’ve been working on
[ThinkCode.TV](http://thinkcode.tv/), a startup that will focus on
producing and selling high-quality programming screencasts in English
and Italian.

**Satish\>\>** What inspired/prompted you to write “Ruby on Rails for
Microsoft Developers”? What need were you trying to fill?

**Antonio\>\>** When people first approach the Rails community, they
immediately notice that there is a huge percentage of Mac users. If you
are developing with Ruby on Rails, it’s almost given that you are using
Mac OS X or Linux. Therefore many books and tutorials on the subject
tend to make assumptions about their audience’s skill set, what
operating system they use and about their editors. This introduces a
major adoption barrier for many developers who are coming from Windows,
who may not be familiar with \*nix operating systems, or may not be able
to afford the latest Mac hardware.

By taking advantage of my background in the .NET world, and my
experience with all the three main operating systems, including Windows,
I thought I would write a Rails book aimed at those who wish to learn
about Rails (but don’t necessarily want to switch their OS, editor and
development environment).

**Satish\>\>** There is some confusion in the minds of the reader
regarding the book’s title. Can you clarify?

**Antonio\>\>** The confusion surrounding the title is quite
understandable. Readers might think, is this a book for people who work
at Microsoft? Is it a book for [.NET
programmers](http://www.daxx.com/view/net_developers_for_hire)? Is it
for those who use Windows as their OS? The answers is that it’s for all
of the above.

As mentioned in my answer to the previous question, this book targets
the wide – and underrepresented – audience of Windows users who may be
familiar with Microsoft development tools. You don’t have to be a .NET
programmer to read this book, but if you are, you’ll find some nice
references and comparisons that will make the learning path a bit
smoother for you. If on the other hand you don’t know the first thing
about .NET, you’ll fully enjoy the book nevertheless. Somewhat
ironically, the first two emails I received as an author, came from
developers who were Windows users, but who had taken the plunge and were
now following the book on Mac OS X.

**Satish\>\>** I know that it is too early to say, but looking back are
there some topics that you now wish should have been covered or dropped
from the book?

**Antonio\>\>** When I started writing the book,
[IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/) was at a very early stage and was
progressing slowly. Now they’ve sped things up and have already reached
a feature rich release (0.9) that isn’t too far from achieving 1.0
stable status. As it stands now, the book is packed full of information
about Rails, but if I were to rewrite the book today, I would dedicate a
solid chapter to IronRuby.

*Thank you Antonio. In case you have any queries and/or questions,
kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and
Antonio would be glad to answer.*

    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Antonio, could you tell us something about yourself &#8211; your background, where you are based?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Antonio>></strong> Sure, Satish. I&#8217;m an Italian hacker living in Toronto, Canada where I work as a Software Engineer and Technical Evangelist for IBM. Part of the reason why I was hired by IBM was due to my expertise and passion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails (which I&#8217;d been following since 2004).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 2006 I developed the first version of the adapter that enables <a href="http://db2express.com/">DB2</a> to work with ActiveRecord/Rails, and have since been engaged in many projects that involved Rails and other dynamic languages and frameworks. I like to think of myself as being a very curious person who always approach new technologies with an open mind. My passion for Ruby and other open source tools turns me into the guy who&#8217;s always pushing for an increased level of adoption of these less common, but exciting technologies within IBM and the enterprise world.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lately, in my limited spare time, I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://thinkcode.tv/">ThinkCode.TV</a>, a startup that will focus on producing and selling high-quality programming screencasts in English and Italian.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> What inspired/prompted you to write &#8220;Ruby on Rails for Microsoft Developers&#8221;? What need were you trying to fill?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Antonio>></strong> When people first approach the Rails community, they immediately notice that there is a huge percentage of Mac users. If you are developing with Ruby on Rails, it&#8217;s almost given that you are using Mac OS X or Linux. Therefore many books and tutorials on the subject tend to make assumptions about their audience&#8217;s skill set, what operating system they use and about their editors. This introduces a major adoption barrier for many developers who are coming from Windows, who may not be familiar with *nix operating systems, or may not be able to afford the latest Mac hardware.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By taking advantage of my background in the .NET world, and my experience with all the three main operating systems, including Windows, I thought I would write a Rails book aimed at those who wish to learn about Rails (but don&#8217;t necessarily want to switch their OS, editor and development environment).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> There is some confusion in the minds of the reader regarding the book&#8217;s title. Can you clarify?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Antonio>></strong> The confusion surrounding the title is quite understandable. Readers might think, is this a book for people who work at Microsoft? Is it a book for <a href="http://www.daxx.com/view/net_developers_for_hire">.NET programmers</a>? Is it for those who use Windows as their OS? The answers is that it&#8217;s for all of the above.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As mentioned in my answer to the previous question, this book targets the wide &#8211; and underrepresented &#8211; audience of Windows users who may be familiar with Microsoft development tools. You don&#8217;t have to be a .NET programmer to read this book, but if you are, you&#8217;ll find some nice references and comparisons that will make the learning path a bit smoother for you. If on the other hand you don&#8217;t know the first thing about .NET, you&#8217;ll fully enjoy the book nevertheless. Somewhat ironically, the first two emails I received as an author, came from developers who were Windows users, but who had taken the plunge and were now following the book on Mac OS X.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> I know that it is too early to say, but looking back are there some topics that you now wish should have been covered or dropped from the book?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Antonio>></strong> When I started writing the book, <a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a> was at a very early stage and was progressing slowly. Now they&#8217;ve sped things up and have already reached a feature rich release (0.9) that isn&#8217;t too far from achieving 1.0 stable status. As it stands now, the book is packed full of information about Rails, but if I were to rewrite the book today, I would dedicate a solid chapter to IronRuby.
  </p>

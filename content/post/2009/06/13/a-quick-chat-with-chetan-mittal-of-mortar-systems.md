    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Chetan, could you tell us something about yourself &#8211; your background, where you are based?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Chetan>></strong> I am born and raised in Chandigarh, India&#8217;s most beautiful city. I am a computer engineer by both qualification and profession, and a MBA from Melbourne Business School (UQ/MtEliza). In 2000 I moved to Australia; worked and stayed there for six years before coming back to India in 2006, year I put my hands on Rails, to start Mortar Systems. I have worked on government projects in Australia for different verticals such as Transport, Healthcare etc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Could you tell us a little more about your company?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Chetan>></strong> Mortar Systems is a small IT boutique where we provide services such as product engineering, web/mobile development and business IT consulting to small and micro enterprises for verticals ranging from retail to high-tech. The technologies we use are open-source such as <strong>Ruby</strong>, Java, Python, SugarCRM etc. We are also partner with SUN in their Startup Essential program for India; with this we can provide discounted software / hardware for our product engineering customers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Typically we follow Agile model and craftsmanship practices. We have experience in providing Scrum and XP training / consulting to some of the IT shops in India.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Getting back to your comnpany, what are your future plans?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Chetan>></strong> Currently we are a team 4 developers, thus our future plan for the next 2 years is to grow this team to at least 50, and build up some expertise in any of the two verticals of our target market. We have successfully signed up a 3 years contract with an outsourced Sales firm, so finger crossed!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Anything else you would like to add?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Chetan>></strong> I would like to add my thoughts on the current IT resources market in India. Nowadays I see a lot of startups coming out of India but not many out of them making it big on international (or even national) circuit. The problem I foresee is that most of these startups are unable to get good team members because the college graduates (not IITs, NITs) just don&#8217;t want to work for them, or just are not skilled enough. I can&#8217;t say much on when the education standards in India will rise, but would like to point out a few startups portals like <a href="http://workforastartup.in/">http://workforastartup.in</a> or others which can help Indian startups to hire really potential talent.

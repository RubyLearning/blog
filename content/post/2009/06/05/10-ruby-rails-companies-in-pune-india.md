    is based on technologies and approaches that ThoughtWorks has used
    effectively with clients for many years. Our deep experience with
    custom software development gives us an accurate picture of when and
    where Ruby is a good fit and when it is not. Our ongoing project
    work with Ruby and Rails proves that Ruby excels in the following
    applications: Web 2.0 applications that make use of REST and/or AJAX
    designs; Small to medium web-based applications with aggressive
    time-to-market goals; Low-cost internal prototypes and pilot
    applications; Highly-targeted internal applications and utility
    programs; So-called “soft layer” APIs on hardened transactional
    systems; Build systems for complex enterprise systems. Ruby’s
    productivity can also result in early hi-fi prototypes that quickly
    allows for the exploration of new ideas. ThoughtWorks Pune also
    hosted the Ruby Fun Day, to have fun playing around with Ruby
    technology and Ruby On Rails. It was a great way to meet fellow Ruby
    enthusiasts and discuss new innovations in the Ruby world. The URL

    best, and beyond that it’s alright to fail and to make mistakes.

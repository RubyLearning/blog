Although Ruby on Rails is relatively new on the scene, it is based on technologies and approaches that ThoughtWorks has used effectively with clients for many years. Our deep experience with custom software development gives us an accurate picture of when and where Ruby is a good fit and when it is not. Our ongoing project work with Ruby and Rails proves that Ruby excels in the following applications: Web 2.0 applications that make use of REST and/or AJAX designs; Small to medium web-based applications with aggressive time-to-market goals; Low-cost internal prototypes and pilot applications; Highly-targeted internal applications and utility programs; So-called &#8220;soft layer&#8221; APIs on hardened transactional systems; Build systems for complex enterprise systems. Ruby&#8217;s productivity can also result in early hi-fi prototypes that quickly allows for the exploration of new ideas. ThoughtWorks Pune also hosted the Ruby Fun Day, to have fun playing around with Ruby technology and Ruby On Rails. It was a great way to meet fellow Ruby enthusiasts and discuss new innovations in the Ruby world. The URL of that event is at <a href="http://www.thoughtworker.com/events/ruby-funday-pune">http://www.thoughtworker.com/events/ruby-funday-pune</a>

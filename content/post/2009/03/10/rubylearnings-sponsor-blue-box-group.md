  <h3>
    New Releases and Future Plans
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Blue Box Group has recently added and updated many of their Box Panel control panel features. One of their personal favorites is the private customer chat that they have added. Now once a customer is logged into their Box Panel account, they are able to start a private chat session with one of their support representatives. If youâ€™ve ever got a quick question that you want to have answered or your siteâ€™s having a problem, you can now privately chat with a support representative who will help you get your problems solved. And itâ€™s all encrypted from end to endâ€” so you can be sure that only you and Blue Box Group are privy to your conversation. Cool beans, eh?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another feature they have released in the past two weeks is their Bundled Content Delivery Network. Now customers of Blue Box Group are able to guarantee their siteâ€™s availability and speed by hosting their static content on their CDN. With 24 points of presence around the globe, no matter where your visitors come from, theyâ€™ll see faster load times and a more reliable application. Find out more about the CDN now!

    Scalability and performance are two of the main problems Rails developers face when developing sites. Blue Box Group has recently partnered with New Relic RPM to provide support and integration of the RPM into Box Panel. All customerâ€™s of Blue Box Group can sign-up for RPM Lite free of charge directly from their Box Panel account. Once signed up, RPM stats are viewable directly from Box Panel. Now developers can get great insight into the inner workings of their applications straight from Blue Box Group. Read their blog entry on this partnership to find out more.

  <p>
    They have also got some great things planned for 2009. Their Box Panel user interface is going to redesigned from the ground up with user-friendliness in mind. They are also planning a new feature to Box Panel allowing customers to clone and deploy VPS images on demand. Need a cluster? Once this feature goes live, youâ€™ll be able to deploy one yourself in just a few minutes. These are just a few of the updates and features they have got planned for 2009. So subscribe to their blog to receive announcements about their latest updates!

It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor – [Blue Box
Group](https://boxpanel.blueboxgrp.com/public/order/partner/43921).

> This year is shaping up to be another big one for Blue Box Group

[Blue Box
Group](https://boxpanel.blueboxgrp.com/public/order/partner/43921) has
got some great new features for release, upgrades to their service
offerings, appearances at various events and conferences and more. Check
out their site and subscribe to their
[blog](http://www.blueboxgrp.com/news) to get the latest updates!<!--more-->

## New Releases and Future Plans

Blue Box Group has recently added and updated many of their Box Panel
control panel features. One of their personal favorites is the private
customer chat that they have added. Now once a customer is logged into
their Box Panel account, they are able to start a private chat session
with one of their support representatives. If youâ€™ve ever got a quick
question that you want to have answered or your siteâ€™s having a
problem, you can now privately chat with a support representative who
will help you get your problems solved. And itâ€™s all encrypted from
end to endâ€” so you can be sure that only you and Blue Box Group are
privy to your conversation. Cool beans, eh?

Another feature they have released in the past two weeks is their
Bundled Content Delivery Network. Now customers of Blue Box Group are
able to guarantee their siteâ€™s availability and speed by hosting their
static content on their CDN. With 24 points of presence around the
globe, no matter where your visitors come from, theyâ€™ll see faster
load times and a more reliable application. Find out more about the CDN
now!

Scalability and performance are two of the main problems Rails
developers face when developing sites. Blue Box Group has recently
partnered with New Relic RPM to provide support and integration of the
RPM into Box Panel. All customerâ€™s of Blue Box Group can sign-up for
RPM Lite free of charge directly from their Box Panel account. Once
signed up, RPM stats are viewable directly from Box Panel. Now
developers can get great insight into the inner workings of their
applications straight from Blue Box Group. Read their blog entry on this
partnership to find out more.

They have also got some great things planned for 2009. Their Box Panel
user interface is going to redesigned from the ground up with
user-friendliness in mind. They are also planning a new feature to Box
Panel allowing customers to clone and deploy VPS images on demand. Need
a cluster? Once this feature goes live, youâ€™ll be able to deploy one
yourself in just a few minutes. These are just a few of the updates and
features they have got planned for 2009. So subscribe to their blog to
receive announcements about their latest updates!

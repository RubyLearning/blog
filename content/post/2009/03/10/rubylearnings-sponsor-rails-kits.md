It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor – [Rails
Kits](http://railskits.com/).

<!--more-->
Rails Kits provides Rails developers with ready-made and well-tested
code for getting projects off to a quick start. Developers can save
time, skipping the boring stuff like writing recurring billing code, and
dive straight in to the fun stuff. Use the Rails Kits to get your
project done in less time and with less work.

In April 2009, [Rails Kits](http://railskits.com/) will celebrate its
first anniversary of launching the first Kit, the [SaaS Rails
Kit](http://railskits.com/saas/). The reception to the SaaS Rails Kit
has been overwhelmingly positive, with great apps like Sifter, Let’s
Freckle, and Expens’d using it. In that year a number of other Kits have
been released, the latest being the Helpdesk Rails Kit. This Kit makes
it easy to add a support section and a knowledge base to your Rails app
(or even as just a standalone site), and it integrates very well with
email to make it a great way to easily provide support for customers
from an individual or a team of people.

This year Rails Kits is looking forward to releasing more Rails Kits
(and they are always open to suggestions from anyone on what would make
a great next Kit to launch). Rails Kits is also eagerly looking forward
to Rails 2.3 with its enhanced Engines support, which will allow them to
make the Kits even easier to integrate into existing Rails projects and
use multiple Kits together.

The people at Rails Kits are also looking forward to seeing the Rails
Kits community grow, meeting new people, and seeing awesome new apps get
built using the tools they provide.

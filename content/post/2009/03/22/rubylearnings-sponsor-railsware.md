It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor –
[Railsware](http://www.railsware.com/).

Twitter, twitter! Are you twittering all around and nobody hears your
sweet voice? That’s strange. Perhaps Twitter isn’t your marketing tool.
However for<!--more--> [Railsware](http://www.railsware.com/), Twitter became that
real call to action when the team of Ruby on Rails developers preaching
methods of agile programming came together in 2005. Until that time
Twitter had not become so ‘rich and famous’ as it is now, developers
were open to new ideas and the goal was somewhere far away.

With its very first project, Railsware got focused on fast
implementation of web applications using [agile
methods](http://www.railsware.com/be-agile). As another example,
37signals became one of those companies who succeeded in elegant and
powerful Rails development. Their book "Getting Real"? became a
universal guide for [Railsware](http://railsware.com/services) to
building successful web applications.

> Railsware for premium-quality web applications

Open-source Rails community gives developers an opportunity to discover
new methods and tools, to meet requirements not met by the licensed
software. Twitter is the same. Even today Twitter is probably the
biggest Rails site on the web and its growing scalability is a loud fact
of its open-source nature.

Do you remember that Email, IM, RSS, SMS and the web are just transports
as well as Twitter? Railsware gives every startup-idea a fast scalable
‘ware’ delivering solution.

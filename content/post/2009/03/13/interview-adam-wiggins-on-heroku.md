On the eve of the first ever online “**Introduction to Sinatra**”
course, Satish Talim and Victor H. Goff III of RubyLearning caught up
with **Adam Wiggins** and talked to him on **Heroku** (pronounced
her-OH-koo), in this interview.<!--more-->

**Satish Talim\>\>** Welcome, Adam and thanks for taking out time to
share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Adam Wiggins\>\>** By day, I’m a Rubyist and entrepeneur. By night, I
evangelize critical thinking and skepticism, pontificate about economics
and cognition, and hack on music software and video games. Some people
have said that I’m a nice guy, but I vehemently deny such a vicious
rumor!

I blog at: [http://adam.blog.heroku.com/](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/)

> Heroku – It’s fast, it’s easy, and it just works.

**Satish\>\>** What’s Heroku and how did you get involved with it?

**Adam\>\>** I co-founded Heroku along with my partners Orion and James
in autumn 2007. Our elevator pitch is “instant Ruby deployment.” Heroku
is the fastest and simplest way to get a Rails, Merb, or Sinatra app
into production.

**Satish\>\>** For a person new to development using Rack and Rack-based
web frameworks (like Sinatra, Merb, Ramaze, and Camping), how can Heroku
help?

**Adam\>\>** Passenger has done a lot for standardizing and simplifying
the deployment of Rack apps, but it’s still up to you to provision your
own server. Since basic Heroku apps are free, there’s nothing to stop
anyone with basic proficiency in Ruby and Git from getting their app
online instantly.

Check out our [tutorial on deploying a Rack
app](http://heroku.com/docs#toc25).

**Victor\>\>** What is the long term goal of Heroku?

**Adam\>\>** I like to think that we’re championing a revolution in app
deployment, similar to the agile revolution that happened in app
development over the past decade. Our vision is for deploying apps into
production to be as easy, fast, and fun as building apps with Rails or
the other great Ruby frameworks.

**Victor\>\>** When are you going to be ready for Prices and Options for
Heroku?

**Adam\>\>** Pricing is already in beta. We don’t publish dates, but we
should have something for public consumption soon. If you’d like to
participate in the pricing beta, contact us:
[http://heroku.com/about](http://heroku.com/about).

**Victor\>\>** I understand that Heroku can be used with Git, but does
that mean I have to leave my other versioning tools behind, or does it
play well with others?

**Adam\>\>** Git can live alongside Subversion or other version-control
tools. In fact, using them in tandem is a pretty good way to ease into
learning Git. You can also use Git purely as a deployment mechanism, as
described [here](http://heroku.com/docs#toc18).

**Victor\>\>** Where can I find out where you are going to be speaking
and when?

**Adam\>\>** Last year I spoke at Railsconf and Rubyconf, among others.
This year I’ll be doing a talk about Rack, Sinatra, and Rails Metal at
Railsconf, and participating in a panel with a bunch of great folks
including the authors of Rack and Thin.

You can always find out what events I and the other cool dudes here at
Heroku are attending, on the sidebar to our
[blog](http://blog.heroku.com/).

**Satish & Victor\>\>** Thanks Adam for sharing your views with the
**Introduction to Sinatra^[1](#fn-1570-1)^** ” and ” **Introduction to
Merb^[2](#fn-1570-2)^** ” course participants. You can connect with Adam
on twitter [here](http://twitter.com/hirodusk).

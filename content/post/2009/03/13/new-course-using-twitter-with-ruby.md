## What’s Twitter?

[Twitter](http://twitter.com/home) is a popular micro-blogging website.
Instead of using this blogging service to write long, in-depth articles,
Twitter users (or “Tweeple”) post single-sentence updates at a time.
Twitter isn’t used as formally as many other blogs, but rather to pass
small pieces of information, links, thoughts or comments to your
friends. Also, instead of people having to visit your Twitter page to
check your updates, they instead visit a page that contains the updates
of everyone they’re following, allowing them to keep up with everyone
with the minimum of effort.

> It’s easy to Twitter-face with Ruby!

It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s excellent sponsor –
Locaweb.^[1](#fn-1536-1)^

> Locaweb is Growing real Fast!

[Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com.br/) has just made a big announcement
this week. All web shared hosting plans now offer \*unlimited\* disk
storage and bandwidth! It may not sound as big as it is if you’re from
the US, for instance, but it is a pretty big deal if you’re from Latin
America. There has been small attempts before by others but this is the
move of the largest web hosting company in Brazil, which changes the
rules of the game. They have also changed their website, with brand new,
more modern layout and design.

They are also been rolling out “Mobimail” the brand new e-mail solution
that’s been offered to all new clients. This new system allows for
better mobility options such as synchronization with smartphones such as
the iPhone through ActiveSync.

Finally, their Cloud Computing platform is also always evolving. They
have rolled out JeOS, Canonical’s virtualization optimized Ubuntu, so
they can offer increased performance and stability for the Linux
environment. Their platform supports both Windows and Linux options with
a large range of prices and customizations. This is the best options for
projects that are beyond web shared hosting.

On the eve of the first ever online “**Introduction to Sinatra**”
course, Satish Talim of RubyLearning caught up with **Aaron Quint** and
talked to him on **Sinatra**, in this interview.

**Satish Talim\>\>** Welcome, Aaron and thanks for taking out time to
share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Aaron Quint\>\>** Thanks for having me! I’m a freelance Ruby developer
working in Brooklyn, NY. I’ve been doing Ruby and Rails for a little
over 3 years now, and full time for the last 2 and a half. Recently I’ve
been getting a lot more involved with the open source community. I
really love coding in Ruby and at this point I don’t think any other
language has such a great community with such smart and interesting
people. I blog (as much as I can) at
[http://quirkey.com/blog/](http://www.quirkey.com/blog/). My other
passions are food and design and I work with a friend writing about this
at [http://thescoutmag.com](http://thescoutmag.com/).

> Sinatra’s greatest strength is its flexibility

**Satish\>\>** You have worked a lot on Rails and Sinatra. How come you
got involved with Sinatra? Tell us more about this.

**Aaron\>\>** I heard about Sinatra when Blake Mizerany first released
it. I thought it was a cool idea, but didn’t really see the point. Then,
in 2008 a number of people started working feverishly on making it a
more elegant framework and I started to get involved. I had a sort of
‘lightbulb’ moment and realized ‘Ah! This can be really useful!’.

**Satish\>\>** So many Ruby-based web frameworks – is this good for
Ruby? Where does Sinatra fit in?

**Aaron\>\>** I’d start off by saying, that Sinatra is really less then
a framework. A framework implies a lot of constraints or conventions,
however, Sinatra really doesn’t limit you at all. An application in
Sinatra can be a single file, multiple files, or multiple files across
directories (more like Rails). There’s a reason that so much of the Ruby
community is focused on building web applications – most applications
and what any of us do on computers is moving towards the web. Ruby is
such an elegant language it lends itself to different people having a
lot of different ideas on the best way to write web apps. I don’t think
of all these frameworks as being in competition, as we saw with the
Rails/Merb merge, everyone is really learning and building on each
other’s ideas and discoveries. Sinatra’s role is the tool for building
web applications when you don’t need any of the features or overhead of
one of the more robust frameworks.

**Satish\>\>** In your recent article for the “Rubyist” magazine, you
mention that “think of Sinatra as a library creating simple HTTP based
user interfaces.” Can you throw more light on this aspect?

**Aaron\>\>** Sinatra’s greatest strength is that its so flexible and
requires so little to get an app running. This makes it super easy to
use it in existing projects. My proposal is that the community should
embrace it by including it in their gems or libraries and making simple
web interfaces for their code. Everyone loves the command line for its
simplicity and directness, but by using Sinatra to build a simple web
app to interact with your code, you can make your library much easier
(and more fun) to use.

**Satish\>\>** For a person new to web development, how can one go about
learning Sinatra?

**Aaron\>\>** I think Sinatra is a great way to get in to Ruby web
development. Its really simple so once you’ve learned the basics,
anything you learn beyond it is learning Ruby and is not Sinatra
specific. Right now there aren’t any dedicated blogs or community sites
but the Sinatra homepage:
[http://www.sinatrarb.com](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) has good
documentation. If you’re interested or have questions, Sinatra also has
an active mailing list and irc chat room. People are usually happy to
answer questions. I would also suggest just searching github for Sinatra
and checking out the source of other Sinatra projects – there are a lot
of good open source examples.

**Satish\>\>** Any plans on writing a book on Sinatra?

**Aaron\>\>** I wouldn’t be against it If someone offered me the
opportunity – though it would be a pretty short book.

**Satish\>\>** Do you have any suggestions for RubyLearning’s
“Introduction to Sinatra” course participants?

**Aaron\>\>** Don’t hesitate to ask questions on the mailing list or in
irc. Also if you already have some understanding of Ruby, you should
absolutely take a look at Sinatra’s source. Most of it is contained in a
single file and its one of the best open source examples of advanced
Ruby.

**Satish\>\>** Thanks Aaron for sharing your views with the
**Introduction to Sinatra^[1](#fn-1726-1)^** ” and ” **Introduction to
Merb^[2](#fn-1726-2)^** ” course participants.

As a follow-up to our earlier post “[50+ Rubyists to Follow on
Twitter](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/10/29/50-rubyists-to-follow-on-twitter/)”
we used **Twitter Grader** to find out the top 5 ranked Rubyists.<!--more-->

### But What’s Twitter Grader?

![Twitter](http://rubylearning.com/images/icon_d.png "http://twitter.com/IndianGuru")

[Twitter Grader](http://twitter.grader.com/) ranks your Twitter profile
up against other users of Twitter, based on things like number of
followers, the power of your follower network, how often you update, and
your profile bio. It gives you two numbers: your overall rank and your
percentage out of 100. It is a fun tool for Twitter users.

### The Top 5 Ranked Rubyists

-   Jason Fried: [jasonfried](http://twitter.com/jasonfried) – Grade:

change with time.

Being a bit of a Twitter Egomaniac, I graded myself too:\
Grade: 99.8 and Rank: 2,694 out of 1,461,068

Not bad!

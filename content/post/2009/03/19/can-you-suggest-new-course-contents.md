We’re rapidly expanding our course offerings here at RubyLearning,
trying to keep up with the enormous and ever-growing interest in
“everything” **Ruby**. We have recently introduced four new courses<!--more-->
namely: “Using Twitter with Ruby”, “Introduction to Sinatra”,
“Introduction to FXRuby” and “Git & GitHub”.

A constant demand at RubyLearning has been for a *free*, introductory
course on “**Ruby Networking and the Internet**“. This could broadly
cover:

-   Networking Concepts
-   Basic Network Operations
-   Sockets
-   Clients and Servers
-   HTTP and the Web
-   EMail
-   FTP
-   A small project

But we need your **YOUR** help, because as you know this is a big
subject and we’d like to be sure to focus in on the areas of most
interest to **you**.

***Please post your suggestions as comments to this blog post**. It
won’t take more than a minute or two.*

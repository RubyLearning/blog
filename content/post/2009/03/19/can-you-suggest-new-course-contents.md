  <h3>
    Can YOU suggest new course contents?
  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    We&#8217;re rapidly expanding our course offerings here at RubyLearning, trying to keep up with the enormous and ever-growing interest in &#8220;everything&#8221; <strong>Ruby</strong>. We have recently introduced four new courses namely: &#8220;Using Twitter with Ruby&#8221;, &#8220;Introduction to Sinatra&#8221;, &#8220;Introduction to FXRuby&#8221; and &#8220;Git & GitHub&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A constant demand at RubyLearning has been for a <em>free</em>, introductory course on &#8220;<strong>Ruby Networking and the Internet</strong>&#8220;. This could broadly cover:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Networking Concepts
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic Network Operations
    </li>
    <li>
      Sockets
    </li>
    <li>
      Clients and Servers
    </li>
    <li>
      HTTP and the Web
    </li>
    <li>
      EMail
    </li>
    <li>
      FTP
    </li>
    <li>
      A small project
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    But we need your <b>YOUR</b> help, because as you know this is a big subject and we&#8217;d like to be sure to focus in on the areas of most interest to <b>you</b>.

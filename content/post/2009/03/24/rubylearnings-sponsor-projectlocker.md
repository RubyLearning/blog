ProjectLocker provides tools and services to help software development
teams quickly set up an enterprise-quality infrastructure at an
affordable price. Using ProjectLocker, teams can spend less time
finding, configuring, and managing tools and more time doing what is
most important â€” writing great software to meet customer needs.

ProjectLocker’s suite of software development tools features source
control with both Git & Subversion hosting, and bug tracking, wiki, and
project management with hosted Trac. These solutions are available
almost immediately after signing up online and come in an array of
subscription packages:

-   *ProjectLocker Free* â€“ an ad-supported option that offers up to
    300MB of space for 2 users that’s available at no cost to the
    clients, who can then earn more space & users through invitations
    and referrals.
-   ProjectLocker Lite â€“ the basic paid service with multiple levels
    (Seed, Angel, Venture, and Equity) tailored to the growth stages of
    a software company that allows clients to gracefully expand as
    needed, starting at \$2.50 per month for 1GB of storage space.
-   ProjectLocker Enterprise â€“ for full scale IT departments seeking
    to lower the total cost of ownership of their development
    infrastructure, where clients have no preset data limits and can
    purchase both ProjectLocker’s standard Trac & SCM offerings as well
    as a number of proprietary productivity tools on an a la carte
    basis.

In addition, ProjectLocker integrates with many of the most popular and
successful development tools in the cloud, including Basecamp, Rally,
FogBugz, Twitter, Jabber, and Mor.ph. These features, along with the
availability of unlimited projects and repositories for all service
levels, lets ProjectLocker provide everything teams need to communicate
with each other and with their customers.

ProjectLocker has a record of customer service and reliability that is
unmatched in the hosted tools space. ProjectLocker provides both e-mail
and telephone technical support to its clients. It also performs hourly
backups of all client data that can be used to implement up to bare
metal restores if necessary and has maintained 99.9% uptime for its
hosted servers since 2003. ProjectLocker’s web-based delivery model
allows teams to access their tools securely anywhere they can access the
Internet â€” even through most client firewalls.

    RPCFN: Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies
  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    After a <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/09/13/poll-ruby-problems-for-beginners-and-prizes/">very encouraging response to our poll</a> from YOU, the readers of the <abbr title="RubyLearning">RL</abbr> blog, RL is happy to announce the first-ever <b>fortnightly</b> (every 14 days) &#8220;<strong>Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)</strong>&#8221; that starts on <b>Friday, 25th Sept. 2009</b>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What Is The RPCFN?
  </h3>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    The RPCFN is a fortnightly (every 14 days) programming challenge for <strong>Ruby Newbies</strong> in the spirit of the <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a>. A new RPCFN will be posted on this <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/">RubyLearning blog</a> every alternate Friday, starting 25th Sept. 2009. The contest is open to individuals only and you are invited to contribute solution(s) and/or discussion(s) as comments to the respective blog post. 13 days after the RPCFN is posted (i.e. on a Thursday), all the solutions will be thrown open for everyone to see and comment upon. The next day i.e. Friday, the cycle begins again. The Ruby working solution(s) should be clear-cut, follow Ruby conventions and still be easy to understand.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    How does RPCFN benefit you?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/15/chris-strom-how-do-i-learn-and-master-sinatra/">Chris Strom</a> (<a title="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/eee_c">twitter</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a title="blog" href="http://japhr.blogspot.com">blog</a>) is one of the problem setters for the RPCFN and has this to say:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      RPCFN is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language. RPCFN provides a fabulous forum for using Ruby in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Ruby well, as each fortnight the best solution to a challenge is chosen. RPCFN is a wonderful introduction to the Ruby language and to the Ruby community. Welcome newbies!
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    How to Enter
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s free. You can enter the challenge by posting the following as a comment to the Ruby challenge blog post that will appear every alternate Friday, starting 25th Sept. 2009:
  </p>

      Your name:
    </li>

      Email address:
    </li>

    <li>
      Explanation (if any):
    </li>
    <li>
      Test cases (if any):
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <b>Note</b>: All solutions posted would be hidden to allow users to come up with their own solutions. The solutions will be revealed only after a winner is chosen.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Notification
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The winning entries will be announced on this blog. The winners will be sent their prizes by email.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Prizes
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    There will normally be two prizes (though we reserve the right to change this for each challenge). One prize will be awarded for the best solution (if there is a tie between answers, then the one who posted first will be the winner) and the other will be decided by randomly selecting one person from all the remaining working solutions for that fortnight (14 days). If a person wins he/she canâ€™t win again in the next, immediate challenge but can still participate. Prizes can range from small cash rewards to free PDFs &#8211; whatever the sponsors of the challenge have offered.

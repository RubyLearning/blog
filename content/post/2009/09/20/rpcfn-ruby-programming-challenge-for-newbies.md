After a [very encouraging response to our
poll](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/09/13/poll-ruby-problems-for-beginners-and-prizes/)
from YOU, the readers of the RL blog, RL is happy to announce the
first-ever **fortnightly** (every 14 days) “**Ruby Programming Challenge
For Newbies (RPCFN)**” that starts on **Friday, 25th Sept. 2009**.

## What Is The RPCFN?

![RPCFN](http://rubylearning.com/images/rubypc.jpg "Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies")

The RPCFN is a fortnightly (every 14 days) programming challenge for
**Ruby Newbies** in the spirit of the [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/).
A new RPCFN will be posted on this [RubyLearning
blog](http://rubylearning.com/blog/) every alternate Friday, starting
25th Sept. 2009. The contest is open to individuals only and you are
invited to contribute solution(s) and/or discussion(s) as comments to
the respective blog post. 13 days after the RPCFN is posted (i.e. on a
Thursday), all the solutions will be thrown open for everyone to see and
comment upon. The next day i.e. Friday, the cycle begins again. The Ruby
working solution(s) should be clear-cut, follow Ruby conventions and
still be easy to understand.

## How does RPCFN benefit you?

([twitter](http://twitter.com/eee_c "twitter") / [blog](http://japhr.blogspot.com "blog"))
is one of the problem setters for the RPCFN and has this to say:

> RPCFN is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take
> you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to
> use the language. RPCFN provides a fabulous forum for using Ruby in
> the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges.
> Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Ruby well, as each
> fortnight the best solution to a challenge is chosen. RPCFN is a
> wonderful introduction to the Ruby language and to the Ruby community.
> Welcome newbies!

## How to Enter

It’s free. You can enter the challenge by posting the following as a
comment to the Ruby challenge blog post that will appear every alternate
Friday, starting 25th Sept. 2009:

-   Your name:
-   Email address:
-   URL of your 125×125 real photo (optional):
-   Brief description of what you do:
-   Country of Residence:
-   Your Solution (i.e. Ruby code):
-   Explanation (if any):
-   Test cases (if any):

**Note**: All solutions posted would be hidden to allow users to come up
with their own solutions. The solutions will be revealed only after a
winner is chosen.

## Notification

The winning entries will be announced on this blog. The winners will be
sent their prizes by email.

## Prizes

There will normally be two prizes (though we reserve the right to change
this for each challenge). One prize will be awarded for the best
solution (if there is a tie between answers, then the one who posted
first will be the winner) and the other will be decided by randomly
selecting one person from all the remaining working solutions for that
fortnight (14 days). If a person wins he/she can’t win again in the
next, immediate challenge but can still participate. Prizes can range
from small cash rewards to free PDFs – whatever the sponsors of the
challenge have offered.

## Sponsors

Any individual or companies interested in sponsoring the fortnightly
event are welcome. Please contact Satish Talim at

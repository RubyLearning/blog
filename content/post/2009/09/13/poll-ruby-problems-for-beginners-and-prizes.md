Many RubyLearning participants wrote in asking RubyLearning to start a
weekly post containing a problem to be solved using Ruby. A problem will
be posted here every week / fortnight and anyone is free to offer their
solution (the solution should be clear-cut, follow Ruby conventions and
still be easy to understand) as a comment to the blog post. A small
panel will evaluate the solutions received and decide the best amongst
them all. The person with the best solution will be awarded a token
prize which could be a [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/) or a
[Pragmatic](http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts) screencast or something
equivalent. Maybe some sponsors could chip in with some prizes!

RubyLearning is open to this idea and will start the same provided there
is a good response to this. There’s a single question poll below which
please answer and what’s more important is to post your thoughts,
suggestions etc. as comments to this blog post.

We do have the [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/), a weekly programming
challenge for Ruby programmers. What’s also needed is something for
programmers starting off with Ruby. Maybe RubyLearning could provide
this.

*We look forward to your response(s) and thoughts, suggestions (thoughts
on the nature of the Ruby problem to be asked, evaluation criteria etc.)
as comments below*.

**Update:** Thank you for the over-whelming response to the poll. The
poll is now closed. As the poll results suggest, RubyLearning is going
ahead and starting off the “Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies
(RPCFN)” from Friday, 25th Sept. 2009. We are also getting a very
positive response from many Ruby Gurus and Sponsors. Work on the
**[RPCFN
FAQ](http://rubylearning.com/blog/ruby-programming-challenge-faq/)** is
underway. In the meantime, we still look forward to your response(s) and
thoughts, suggestions (thoughts on the nature of the Ruby problem to be
asked, evaluation criteria etc.) as comments below.

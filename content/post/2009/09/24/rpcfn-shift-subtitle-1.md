  <h3>
    About Fabio Akita
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="Fabio Akita" src="http://www.rubylearning.com/images/akita.jpg" alt="Fabio Akita" /><strong>Fabio Akita</strong> is a Brazilian Rails enthusiast, also known online as &#8220;AkitaOnRails&#8221;. He regularly write posts on his own <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/">blog</a> and had published the very first book tailored for the Brazilian audience called &#8220;Repensando a Web com Rails&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He is now a full-time Ruby on Rails developer working as Project Manager at <a href="http://www.locaweb.com/default.html?utm_campaign=Rails&utm_source=rubylearning&utm_medium=quadrado">Locaweb</a>, Brazil. He&#8217;s also the creator of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/">Rails Summit Latin America</a>&#8220;, the largest international Rails event in South America.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fabio has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>If you&#8217;re learning a new language such as Ruby, it is important that you practice it. And the best way to start is by scratching your own itch. Anything goes. It&#8217;s not unusual to start by writing simple command line scripts to help out your everyday routine. That&#8217;s why I thought of a very trivial exercise in the first challenge. It should demand that you know the basics for a variety of Ruby subjects such as regular expressions, file manipulation, time calculation and so on. The only way to achieve mastery is by practice. So let&#8217;s get started!</em>
    </p>

    The Ruby Challenge
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <img class="alignright" src='http://rubylearning.com/images/rubypc.jpg' style="border: 0px none ;" alt="RPCFN" title="Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Ruby beginner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Goals</b>: Basic control over Ruby elements, specially command line scripting.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Description</b>: There are several ways to subtitle a movie nowadays, and one of the most well known format is the SubRip format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip</a>). It has entries like these:
  </p>
  
  <pre>645
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:54,893
the government is implementing a new policy...

646
01:31:54,928 --> 01:31:57,664
In connection with a dramatic increase
in crime in certain neighbourhoods,
</pre>
  
  <p>
    Each line has an increasing integer identification, then comes the time range (start and end time) in the format &#8220;hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds&#8221;. The decimal separator used is the comma. Finally there are the subtitles themselves and a line break marks the end of an entry.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes the timing is shifted for a small amount, 2 or 3 seconds. Then comes the trouble when you need to shift everything a few seconds back or ahead.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The goal is to create a small command line script in Ruby that will read an SRT file, and output another one with the new calculated times.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, for example, if I want to shift everything 2,500 (2 seconds and 500 milliseconds) ahead, I would start with this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:07,769
</pre>
  
  <p>
    and end up with:
  </p>
  
  <pre>01:32:06,783 --> 01:32:10,269
</pre>
  
  <p>
    The command line should accept arguments such as:
  </p>
  
  <pre>shift_subtitle --operation add --time 02,110 input_file output_file
</pre>
  
  <p>
    This means &#8220;&#45;&#45;operation&#8221; can accept either &#8216;add&#8217; or &#8216;sub&#8217; to add or subtract times. The &#8220;&#45;&#45;time&#8221; will accept the amount of time to shift in the format 11,222 where &#8220;11&#8221; is the amount of seconds and &#8220;222&#8221; the amount of milliseconds.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Requirements</b>: This has to be a pure Ruby script, using only the Ruby Standard Libraries (meaning, no external Gems).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It has to implement &#8220;optparse&#8221; to parse the command line arguments.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As an observation, bear in mind that the first thing that you might attempt will look like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>a = Time.at(04,283)
b = a + 2.500
puts b.usec
=> 500283
</pre>
  
  <p>
    This is wrong, the proper result should&#8217;ve been &#8220;783&#8221; (as in the example in the previous section). So it means that you will have to find another way out.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Extras (Optional)</b>: If you want:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      It would be interesting to exercise the process of a Gem creation. So you would have to package your script.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another thing that would be good is to have RSpec unit tests covering your code, to exercise software development best practices.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <b>(Note that the above two points are optional and not a requirement).</b>

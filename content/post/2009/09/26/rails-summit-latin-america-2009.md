[![Rails Summit Latin America

Back in 2005 there was virtually no Ruby community in Brazil. David
Hansson himself was there, at the FISL conference, showcasing a pre-1.0
Rails (which later became the famous 15-min blog screencast). Only 3
years later the community grew<!--more--> up dramatically and in 2008, Rails
Summit Latin America was unleashed and it was a huge success. They had more
than 20 international speakers, more than 550 attendees in 2 full days with 2
parallel tracks, real-time translators, coffee-break, lunch, ubiquitous wi-fi,
and much more. They targetted a RailsConf-like event and I think they
delivered.

This year they want to repeat the success with the 2nd edition of the
Summit. Itâ€™s going to happen at the same place, in Sao Paulo City,
Brazil. They expect to see people through out South America.

Attend to celebrate Rails, get to know other Railers, increase your
business network and, of course, learn even more about Ruby and Rails.

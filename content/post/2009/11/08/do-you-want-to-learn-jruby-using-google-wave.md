RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Ruby Metaprogramming, Git
& GitHub, FXRuby, Shoes, JRuby, Sinatra and Merb. Since 2005, over
15,000 participants spread across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and
other Ruby related timely topics. This has been possible due to the
extensive support provided by the mentors of these courses. RL strives
hard to improve the methodology and course content based on the
extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks to **YOU**, the Ruby
community, people like Fabio Akita and companies like Locaweb who make
this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

## But What is Google Wave?

[Google
Wave](http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave)^[1](#fn-3259-1)^
is a new web-based collaboration tool that enables groups of people to
edit and discuss documents simultaneously on the web. At first, Wave can
feel overwhelming, especially if you’re trying to understand it as a
type of tool you already know—such as email, a document collaboration
tool, or instant messenger. Wave combines features from all three of
those types of tools.

To really understand Google Wave, I would recommend Gina Trapani’s
excellent online tutorial “[The Complete Guide to Google
Wave](http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave)“.

## Advantages of using Google Wave

A tool such as Google Wave enables the students to collaborate together
in an online environment. Wave replaces the need for multiple services
such as a Wiki to post work, Google Docs to collaborate on documents,
email to communicate asynchronously, and instant messaging services to
communicate synchronously. From personal experience with using
technology with students I have learned that the simplest solution is
the best. Using one tool instead of four is a great advancement.

Thus, you could have one master notebook, where you could verify all the
information, highlight what will probably be the most important things
to learn, and just improve the process of studying completely.

Another feature of Wave that would be useful for education purposes, is
the play-back ability – “so instructors can see exactly who did what,
and see the progression of ideas.”

## What’s JRuby?

**JRuby** is a 100% pure-Java implementation of the Ruby programming
language.

Recently, JRuby has been gaining more and more attention in the Java and
Ruby communities. Java is a powerful platform and there are millions of
lines of Java code being written each month, that the world will have to
live with for a long time from now. By leveraging Java the platform with
the power of the Ruby programming language, programmers will get the
best from both worlds. You better not ignore JRuby any more!

This is what some experts have to say about JRuby.

**Martin Fowler:**

> For Ruby Developers, JRuby offers a deployment platform that is well
> understood, particular in corporations. For a Java community, JRuby is
> important because it offers a chance to experience a powerful language
> and framework while still taking advantage of Java’s excellent
> libraries and the ability to work in both Ruby and Java.

**[Pat
Eyler](http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/12/satish-talimsnew-ruby-class-and.html):**

> Pretty soon, JRuby will be our common gateway between the
> infrastructure world of quick Ruby scripting and the application world
> of large-scale Java apps.

## Why Use Google Wave To Teach JRuby?

At [RubyLearning.org](http://rubylearning.org/), we have been teaching
the Ruby programming language and related libraries, api’s and
frameworks for the past three years, using traditional tools. With the
advent of Google Wave, we wanted to try and understand ourselves the
effectiveness of using Google Wave as a teaching tool.

## Who’s It For?

-   You need to know the basics of Java and Ruby programming languages.
-   You need to have a Google Wave account to access the invite-only
    “**RubyLearning JRuby Wave**“.
-   You should be able to use Google Wave effectively. If you are not
    comfortable with Google Wave, read the excellent free, online
    tutorial “[The Complete Guide to Google
    Wave](http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave)“.

## What Will I Learn?

This is an introductory course on JRuby, wherein you will:

-   learn to call Java classes from Ruby, and
-   learn to call Ruby classes from Java.

**On completion of this course you will be comfortable programming in
JRuby.**

## When And Where Do I Start?

Impatient? Well before we start off with this course, I would appreciate
**your feedback** (as comments to this blog post). Feedback could be on:

-   Appropriateness of using Google Wave as a learning tool.
-   Suggestions for the format of the course.
-   How you could contribute to this learning experience.
-   Any other suggestions.

When you make a comment, please leave your Google Wave address, so that
I can invite you once the “RubyLearning JRuby Wave” is ready. If the
response is encouraging, I shall make this a public wave.

**Update (11th Nov.): The JRuby course has started and so far 90
participants have registered. You can join the course anytime you want.
Just post your Google Wave address as a comment to this blog post.**

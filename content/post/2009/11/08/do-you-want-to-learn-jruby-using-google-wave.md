  <h3>
    But What is Google Wave?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave">Google Wave</a><sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-3259-1' id='fnref-3259-1'>1</a></sup> is a new web-based collaboration tool that enables groups of people to edit and discuss documents simultaneously on the web. At first, Wave can feel overwhelming, especially if you&#8217;re trying to understand it as a type of tool you already know—such as email, a document collaboration tool, or instant messenger. Wave combines features from all three of those types of tools.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To really understand Google Wave, I would recommend Gina Trapani&#8217;s excellent online tutorial &#8220;<a href="http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave">The Complete Guide to Google Wave</a>&#8220;.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Advantages of using Google Wave
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A tool such as Google Wave enables the students to collaborate together in an online environment. Wave replaces the need for multiple services such as a Wiki to post work, Google Docs to collaborate on documents, email to communicate asynchronously, and instant messaging services to communicate synchronously. From personal experience with using technology with students I have learned that the simplest solution is the best. Using one tool instead of four is a great advancement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thus, you could have one master notebook, where you could verify all the information, highlight what will probably be the most important things to learn, and just improve the process of studying completely.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another feature of Wave that would be useful for education purposes, is the play-back ability &#8211; &#8220;so instructors can see exactly who did what, and see the progression of ideas.&#8221;

  <h3>
    What&#8217;s JRuby?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>JRuby</strong> is a 100% pure-Java implementation of the Ruby programming language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Recently, JRuby has been gaining more and more attention in the Java and Ruby communities. Java is a powerful platform and there are millions of lines of Java code being written each month, that the world will have to live with for a long time from now. By leveraging Java the platform with the power of the Ruby programming language, programmers will get the best from both worlds. You better not ignore JRuby any more!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is what some experts have to say about JRuby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Martin Fowler:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      For Ruby Developers, JRuby offers a deployment platform that is well understood, particular in corporations. For a Java community, JRuby is important because it offers a chance to experience a powerful language and framework while still taking advantage of Java&#8217;s excellent libraries and the ability to work in both Ruby and Java.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    <strong><a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/12/satish-talimsnew-ruby-class-and.html">Pat Eyler</a>:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Pretty soon, JRuby will be our common gateway between the infrastructure world of quick Ruby scripting and the application world of large-scale Java apps.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    Why Use Google Wave To Teach JRuby?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    At <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">RubyLearning.org</a>, we have been teaching the Ruby programming language and related libraries, api&#8217;s and frameworks for the past three years, using traditional tools. With the advent of Google Wave, we wanted to try and understand ourselves the effectiveness of using Google Wave as a teaching tool.
  </p>
  
  <h3>

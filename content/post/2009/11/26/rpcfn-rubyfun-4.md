    About Michael Kohl
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="Michael Kohl" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/michael_kohl.jpg" alt="Michael Kohl" />Michael Kohl (<a href="http://twitter.com/citizen428">Twitter</a> / <a href="http://citizen428.net/">blog</a>) in his day job, works as an IT systems engineer in Vienna, Austria. He fell in love with Ruby in 2003 or so, maintained various Ruby-related packages for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> from 2004-2006 and started being an assistant teacher for <a href="http://www.rubylearning.org/class/">RubyLearning.org</a> in early 2009. Besides all things Ruby his interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign languages, (functional) programming languages (e.g. Clojure, Haskell), chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn&#8217;t need to sleep.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Michael has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>The best way to learn programming is to write code! Ruby is fun because it&#8217;s easy to achieve results and I really believe that the RPCFN shows new Rubyists how much they can accomplish with relatively little Ruby. Thinking about a problem and then being able to compare your own solution to dozens of others is a lot of fun and a great opportunity for learning, so make sure to take part in these challenges! The reason that I picked this particular challenge is that it&#8217;s easy to solve, but requires a bit of thinking to get a somewhat attractive solution.</em>
    </p>

    The Ruby Challenge
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <img class="alignright" src='http://rubylearning.com/images/rubypc.jpg' style="border: 0px none ;" alt="RPCFN" title="Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You just started working for CoolNewCompany which is developing mathematics related software. Since you are new to the team, your boss gives you an easy task to test your abilities. Write a class that pretty-prints <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">polynomials</a>, following some simple rules:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      if a coefficient is 1, it doesn&#8217;t get printed
    </li>
    <li>
      if a coefficient is negative, you have to display something like &#8220;- 2x^3&#8243;, not &#8220;+ -2x^3&#8243;
    </li>
    <li>
      if a coefficient is 0, nothing gets added to the output
    </li>
    <li>
      for x^1 the ^1 part gets omitted
    </li>
    <li>
      x^0 == 1, so we don&#8217;t need to display it
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s a couple of usage examples:
  </p>
  
  <pre>puts Polynomial.new([-3,-4,1,0,6]) # => -3x^4-4x^3+x^2+6
puts Polynomial.new([1,0,2]) # => x^2+2
</pre>
  
  <p>
    Don&#8217;t concern yourself too much with error handling, but if somebody tries to create a polynomial with less than 2 elements, your program has to raise an <b>ArgumentError</b> with the message &#8220;Need at least 2 coefficients.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please check the <a href="https://gist.github.com/280aa4797a580fb8ae75">provided unit tests</a> for more examples and make sure to use them for verifying your solution!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Requirements</b>: This has to be a pure Ruby script, using only the Ruby Standard Libraries (meaning, no external Gems). You <b>do not</b> need to build a gem for this. Pure Ruby code is all that is needed.
  </p>

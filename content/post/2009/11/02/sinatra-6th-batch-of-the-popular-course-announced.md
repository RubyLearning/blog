## Sinatra: 6th Batch of the Popular Course Announced

RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Ruby Metaprogramming, Git
& GitHub, FXRuby, Shoes, JRuby, Sinatra and Merb. Since 2005, over
15,000 participants spread across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and
other Ruby related timely topics. This has been possible due to the
extensive support provided by the mentors of these courses. RL strives
hard to improve the methodology and course content based on the
extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks to **YOU**, the Ruby
community, people like Fabio Akita and companies like Locaweb who make
this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

After the huge success of the first five batches of the “**Introduction
to Sinatra**” course, RubyLearning announces the sixth batch from **28th
Nov. 2009**.

> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services

## What’s Sinatra?

Sinatra is a micro-framework for quickly creating *tiny
web-applications* and *small services* in Ruby. It is not a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) based framework.

Please read – [Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why it
Matters](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html).

create free hosting accounts for all the participants, to host their
apps created during the course. Heroku – it’s fast, it’s easy, and it
just works!

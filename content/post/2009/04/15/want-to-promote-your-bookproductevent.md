## Want to promote your book/product/event?

RubyLearning is pleased to announce that we shall be running **book
promotions** on RubyLearning.org. This is probably the most powerful
marketing you can do without giving us any money. For all the details,
[download our brochure](http://rubylearning.com/data/BookPromotion.pdf).
If you have something other than a book, don’t worry. We plan to do this
for products, classes/courses and events too.

The general idea is that we tell our members (via email) about your
book/product/event (all must be related to Ruby in some way) and that we
are giving one or more copies/tickets away. We also tell them that one
of the authors/developers/instructors will be visiting us for the next
few days in one of our forums. The members will interact with the
author/developer/instructor and would post their questions/queries with
respect to the book/product/event. After four days, we give away one or
more copies/tickets of the product (“we” being “you”).

[![Wicked Cool Ruby
Scripts](http://rubylearning.com/images/wcRuby.jpg "Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts")](http://www.nostarch.com/wcruby.htm)

To begin with, we are promoting the book “[Wicked Cool Ruby
Scripts](http://nostarch.com/wcruby.htm)” from [No Starch
Press](http://nostarch.com/) from 28th to 30th April. Anyone interested
in Ruby programming can register at
[RubyLearning.org](http://rubylearning.org/) and enroll
[here](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=35) using
enrollment key **BPCE101**. So hurry. You could win this book.

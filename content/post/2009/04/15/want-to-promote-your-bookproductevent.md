  <h3>
    Want to promote your book/product/event?
  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    RubyLearning is pleased to announce that we shall be running <strong>book promotions</strong> on RubyLearning.org. This is probably the most powerful marketing you can do without giving us any money. For all the details, <a href="http://rubylearning.com/data/BookPromotion.pdf">download our brochure</a>. If you have something other than a book, don&#8217;t worry. We plan to do this for products, classes/courses and events too.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The general idea is that we tell our members (via email) about your book/product/event (all must be related to Ruby in some way) and that we are giving one or more copies/tickets away. We also tell them that one of the authors/developers/instructors will be visiting us for the next few days in one of our forums. The members will interact with the author/developer/instructor and would post their questions/queries with respect to the book/product/event. After four days, we give away one or more copies/tickets of the product (&#8220;we&#8221; being &#8220;you&#8221;).

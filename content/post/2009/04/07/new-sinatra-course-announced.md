## Introduction to Sinatra Course

RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Git & GitHub, FXRuby,
Shoes, JRuby, Sinatra and Merb. Since 2005, over 8300 participants
spread across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and other Ruby related
timely topics. This has been possible due to the extensive support
provided by the patrons, mentors and assistant teachers of these
courses. RL strives hard to improve the methodology and course content
based on the extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks to
**YOU**, the Ruby community, people like Fabio Akita and companies like
Locaweb who make this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

After the huge success of the first-ever online “**Introduction to
Sinatra**” course, RubyLearning announces the second batch from 2nd May
2009.

> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services

## What’s Sinatra?

Sinatra is a micro-framework for quickly creating *tiny
web-applications* and *small services* in Ruby. It is not a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) based framework.

Please read – [Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why it
Matters](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html).

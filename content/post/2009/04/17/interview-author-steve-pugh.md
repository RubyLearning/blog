**Satish\>\>** Steve, could you tell us something about yourself – your
background, where you are based?

**Steve\>\>** I’m from the United States, have a Bachelor of Science
degree in Computer Science from Valdosta State University, and a Master
of Management degree from the University of Phoenix. Additionally, I’m a
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and a Certified Information Systems
Security Professional (CISSP). I have a strong passion for programming,
which I have been doing since high school. Aside from that, I’m into
information security, photography, and working out with CrossFit.

**Satish\>\>** Your book “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts” – what is it about?

**Steve\>\>** “**Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts**” is a book about using Ruby
at the tactical level and in real world scenarios. The book will take
the reader on a journey of thinking about Ruby’s applications. The idea
was to compel readers to think about applying Ruby to solve problems
they may face. I’ve noticed people I interact with doing repetitive
tasks that could easily be scripted in Ruby. Ruby is powerful, and I
feel that the language has been overshadowed by the Rails
framework–almost to its detriment. This book is about Ruby,
specifically. So, to that end, the book took a collection of scripts and
dissected them. Each script was analyzed, specific points of interest
were identified, and then the reader was asked to build upon the script,
thus personalizing it.

**Satish\>\>** Who is the book targeted at?

**Steve\>\>** The book is targeted at people who know the basics of
Ruby, have written “Hello World” programs, have played with
str.downcase, and are curious about what’s next. The scripts are a nice
reference for any Rubyist. I see this book as my contribution to the
mosaic of our Ruby Common Body of Knowledge.

**Satish\>\>** Since you have a collection of scripts, how is your book
different from a Ruby Cookbook?

**Steve\>\>** I didn’t want to recreate a ‘cookbook’, which
traditionally tend to be script-after-script-after-script. If you’ll
notice, the book’s progression is intentional, each chapter touching on
a slightly more complex script or revisiting other scripts from a
different perspective. The focus of “Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts” is on
learning some more advanced Ruby uses rather than strictly being a
reference manual. I was happy with the book’s trajectory, and the
feedback we’ve received reinforces that.

**Satish\>\>** What’s been your experience with the publisher – No
Starch\
 Press?

**Steve\>\>** No Starch Press is great. Tyler, Bill, Megan, and the rest
of the crew in San Francisco are fantastic. They took care of so many
tasks which allowed me to focus on just writing the book. I would highly
recommend that anyone considering writing a techie book give No Starch a
call. I’m open to helping those would-be authors draft proposals or
develop ideas.

**Satish\>\>** Anything else you would like to add?

**Steve\>\>** I appreciate Satish hosting this interview and allowing me
the opportunity to interact with the RubyLearning community.

*Thank you Steve. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Steve would
be glad to answer.*

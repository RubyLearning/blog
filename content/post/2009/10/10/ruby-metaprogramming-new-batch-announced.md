RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Git & GitHub, FXRuby,
Shoes, JRuby, Sinatra and Merb. Since 2005, over 15000 participants
spread across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and other Ruby related
timely topics. This has been possible due to the extensive support
provided by the patrons, mentors and assistant teachers of these
courses. RL strives hard to improve the methodology and course content
based on the extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks to
**YOU**, the Ruby community, people like Fabio Akita and companies like
[Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.asp?utm_campaign=Rails&utm_source=rubylearning&utm_medium=banner)
who make this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

After the huge success of the first-ever “**Ruby Metaprogramming**”
course, RubyLearning now announces the second official batch from 21st
Nov. 2009.

### What’s Ruby Metaprogramming?

Paolo Perrotta, author of the book “[Metaprogramming
Ruby](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby)” has
this to say:

> As a Ruby programmer, you already know how much fun it is. Now see how
> to unleash its power, digging under the surface and exploring the
> language’s most advanced features: a collection of techniques and
> tricks known as *metaprogramming*. Once the domain of expert Rubyists,
> metaprogramming is now accessible to programmers of all levels – from
> beginner to expert.

Paolo goes on to say the following in a [recent
interview](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/):

> I realized that metaprogramming sits at the very heart of the
> language, and when you understand *metaprogramming*, that’s the moment
> you start “thinking in Ruby”.

### Who’s It For?

Anyone who has some background in Core Ruby can make the most out of
this course.

Dates
-----

The course starts on 21st Nov. 2009 and runs for 2 weeks. You first need
to [register on the site](http://rubylearning.org/) and then [enroll
into the course](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=48).

What Will I Learn?
------------------

The brief outline of this course is:

**First Week:**

-   Review the object model of Ruby itself:
    -   read-only variable self
    -   singleton class
    -   scope of variables
-   Learn a lot of methods:
    -   eval
    -   instance\_eval
    -   class\_eval (aka: module\_eval)
    -   class\_variable\_set
    -   class\_variable\_get
    -   class\_variables (Try it out: instance\_variables)
    -   instance\_variable\_set (Try it out: instance\_variable\_get)
    -   define\_method
    -   const\_set
    -   const\_get (Try it out: constants)
    -   Class.new (Try it out: Struct.new)
    -   binding (Try it out: lambda)
    -   send (Try it out: method)
    -   remove\_method
    -   undef\_method
    -   method\_missing
    -   include
    -   extend
    -   included
    -   extended
-   Do the following five exercises and discuss them in the forum.
    -   Exercise 1: Get the values from outside the class.
    -   Exercise 2: Add your code to display ‘I like metaprogramming!’
    -   Exercise 3: Show lots of ways to define singleton method.
    -   Exercise 4: Glance inside Ruby with binding method.
    -   Exercise 5: Define a class without class and def.

**Second Week:**

-   Do practice with two assignments on how to write a tiny app with
    Ruby Metaprogramming techniques.
    -   Assignment 1: Define class Dog – There are three dogs named
        Lassie, Fido and Stimpy. Lassie and Fido can dance, but Stimpy
        can’t… (to be continued later)
    -   Assignment 2: Create your own alias\_method\_chain – Rails
        provides a generic aliasing method, alias\_method\_chain, as the
        ActiveSupport library. Let’s try to write our own method!

### Who is conducting this course?

The course is conducted by **Satoshi Asakawa** from Japan with 24×7 help
from the mentors at RubyLearning. Satoshi is a Japanese Ruby enthusiast.

### Early Bird Registration Discounts

-   For the first 20 registrations, Course Fee: US\$ 5 per participant.
-   For the next 20 registrations, Course Fee US\$ 7 per participant.
-   After the first 40 registrations, Course Fee US\$ 9 per participant.

The course fee goes towards maintaining RubyLearning and helps provide

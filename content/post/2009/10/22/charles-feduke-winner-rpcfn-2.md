    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Welcome Charles and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Charles>></strong> Thanks Sathish for the opportunity. I am a software developer who has spent a lot of time writing code on the Windows platform and a little bit of time working on Unix, mostly in Perl. I am also an avid wargaming hobbyist and my wife and I own a brick and mortar retail store.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How did you get involved with Ruby programming?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Charles>></strong> I started working with Ruby as part of a &#8220;learn a new programming language each year&#8221; initiative. Ruby was the shiniest thing, so I reached for it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Charles>></strong> Flexible syntax because it allows me to express my code in a more readable way. Default arguments; significantly better than writing a bunch of method overload signatures. Heredoc, I know its weird, but I really appreciate having them available.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Charles>></strong> Awesome, I had a lot of fun with with challenges #2 and #1. Being able to see how other people solve these problems is a great benefit. When I saw Chris Strom&#8217;s solution for #2 it was like math class came rushing back to me! Not only do I get to see how to structure Ruby code and projects properly but I also learn different approaches to solving problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish>></strong> What are your future plans?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Charles>></strong> Continue improving my knowledge of Ruby. I am a professional C# developer so I am looking forward to using Cucumber with IronRuby for BDD next year. In my spare time I am working on a Ruby on Rails project for my retail store.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><em>Thank you Charles. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Charles would be glad to answer.</em></span>

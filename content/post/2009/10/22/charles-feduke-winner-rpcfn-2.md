**Satish\>\>** Welcome Charles and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Charles\>\>** Thanks Sathish for the opportunity. I am a software
developer who has spent a lot of time writing code on the Windows
platform and a little bit of time working on Unix, mostly in Perl. I am
also an avid wargaming hobbyist and my wife and I own a brick and mortar
retail store.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Charles\>\>** I started working with Ruby as part of a “learn a new
programming language each year” initiative. Ruby was the shiniest thing,
so I reached for it.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Charles\>\>** Flexible syntax because it allows me to express my code
in a more readable way. Default arguments; significantly better than
writing a bunch of method overload signatures. Heredoc, I know its
weird, but I really appreciate having them available.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Charles\>\>** Awesome, I had a lot of fun with with challenges \#2 and
\#1. Being able to see how other people solve these problems is a great
benefit. When I saw Chris Strom’s solution for \#2 it was like math
class came rushing back to me! Not only do I get to see how to structure
Ruby code and projects properly but I also learn different approaches to
solving problems.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Charles\>\>** Continue improving my knowledge of Ruby. I am a
professional C\# developer so I am looking forward to using Cucumber
with IronRuby for BDD next year. In my spare time I am working on a Ruby
on Rails project for my retail store.

*Thank you Charles. In case you have any queries and/or questions,
kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and
Charles would be glad to answer.*

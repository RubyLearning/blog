**Satish\>\>** Welcome Felipe and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Felipe\>\>** Thanks Sathish for the opportunity. Well, about me… I’m a
Brazilian guy, a web developer and a Mac user. I’m 22 years old and I
started to program at school, since I was 16. Since then, programming
has become my life and I can’t imagine myself doing any other thing.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Felipe\>\>** I discovered Ruby through Rails on a well-known website
by Brazilians: iMasters. I was just amazed as it was so easy to
understand the Ruby code and I could solve the problems in a very simple
way. This got me very motivated and I became more interested in the
subject. At that time, I was working with ASP and I was deciding whether
to learn Java or .NET. By then, I had realized that Ruby was simpler and
I decided to learn it.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Felipe\>\>** One of the things that caught my attention was the fact
that Ruby is an extremely dynamic language. The way I can open classes
and add my own methods is one of the features I like most. Creating DSLs
was something I had never seen before and which I found very
interesting. These are some of the features I remember at the moment,
although I like almost everything in the language.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Felipe\>\>** Despite knowing Ruby for almost two years, I had never
written more than 50 lines of code. I had not found a project that
motivated me to practice. However the **RPCFN** aroused me! Also, I
enjoyed the challenge very much. I recommend everybody to take part in
the **RPCFN**. Even if you know the language, there is always something
new to learn. I intend to participate in all the forthcoming challenges.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Felipe\>\>** I want to study Ruby and Rails deeper, and also learn
other languages (Python and Erlang are already on my list). In the short
ter, I intend to share whatever I learn about Ruby and about programming
in general; perhaps starting my own blog or something else.

*Thank you Felipe. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Felipe
would be glad to answer.*

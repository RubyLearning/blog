  <h2>
    Throw, Catch, Raise, Rescue&#8230; I&#8217;m so confused!
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Avdi Grimm</strong> explains the usage of Throw, Catch, Raise, Rescue in the Ruby programming language.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      You&#8217;ve probably noticed that Ruby has <code>throw</code> and <code>catch</code>&#8230; but they don&#8217;t seem to be used the way you&#8217;re used to in other languages! And there are also these <code>begin</code>, <code>raise</code> and <code>rescue</code> statements that seem to do the same thing. What&#8217;s going on here?
    </p>

    Performance Testing Rails Applications &#8211; How To?

  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Rails&#8217; performance testing tools allow you to quickly detect performance bottlenecks. As a rule of thumb, use benchmarking to detect the problem and then use profiling to understand it.

    Do you ponder what to name things in your code?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Evan Light</strong> asks &#8211; do you ponder what to name things in your code?
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Most of the time, someone has to maintain that pile of crap you just birthed! It may be someone else. It may be you! But it&#8217;s always wise to pretend that the person who will own your code next is an axe-wielding lunatic who knows where you live!

    How do I smell Ruby code?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Timon Vonk</strong> talks about Ruby code smells in an effort to improve Ruby code.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Writing bad code isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Not understanding the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve any better after having written that piece of code is. Fortunately, that happens far less often.

  <h2>
    How do I test my code with Minitest?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Steve Klabnik</strong> introduces the readers to Ruby&#8217;s minitest.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      You run your program, try a few different inputs, check the outputs, and see that they&#8217;re right. Then, you make some changes in your code, and you&#8217;d like to see if they work or not, so you fire up Ruby and try those inputs again. That repetition should stick out. There has to be a better way.

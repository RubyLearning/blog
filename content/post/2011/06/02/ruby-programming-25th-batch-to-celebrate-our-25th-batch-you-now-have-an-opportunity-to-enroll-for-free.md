    What&#8217;s Ruby?

  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/</a> &#8211; &#8220;Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Ruby&#8217;s elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to write.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Yukihiro Matsumoto</b>, the creator of Ruby, in <b><a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">an interview</a></b> says -
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They don&#8217;t want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    What Will I Learn?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html">essential features of Ruby</a> that you will end up using every day.

  <p>
    Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding challenge in the mix, appropriate for the level we are at. We have been known to give out a prize or two for the &#8216;best&#8217; solution.

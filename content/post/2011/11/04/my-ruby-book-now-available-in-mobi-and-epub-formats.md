    Here&#8217;s what one satisfied customer, Thomas Johan Eggum from Norway has to say:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      After years with Java development and some various experience with the framework Ruby on Rails, I wanted to get a broader knowledge with the Ruby language. I stumbled over Satish&#8217;s website rubylearning.com, and decided to read the book &#8220;The Ultimate Guide To Ruby Programming&#8221;. I found the book easy to read and very efficient with regards to covering the essentials of Ruby. There is no confusing overhead, and the material is presented in an informative way. After each chapter there is a summary and an exercise part, making it easy to verify progress. I can highly recommend this book for those interested in learning Ruby. I also found the book helpful when studying towards the certification &#8220;Ruby Association Certified Ruby Programmer Silver&#8221;.
    </p>

  <p>
    The Kindle version is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0062X2I68">Amazon</a>.

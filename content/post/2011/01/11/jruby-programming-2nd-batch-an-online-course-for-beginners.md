    According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby</a> &#8211; &#8220;JRuby is a Java implementation of the Ruby programming language, being developed by the JRuby team. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code.&#8221;

    <b><a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1590598814">Martin Fowler</a></b> says -
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      For Ruby Developers, JRuby offers a deployment platform that is well understood, particular in corporations. For a Java community, JRuby is important because it offers a chance to experience a powerful language and framework while still taking advantage of Java&#8217;s excellent libraries and the ability to work in both Ruby and Java.

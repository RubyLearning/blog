Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies FAQ
==========================================

What Is The Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The RPCFN is a monthly programming challenge for **Ruby Newbies** in the
spirit of the [Ruby
Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/).
A new RPCFN will be posted on the [RubyLearning
blog](http://rubylearning.com/blog/)
every 1st of the month (normally). The contest is open to individuals
only and you are invited to contribute solution(s) and/or discussion(s)
as comments to the respective blog post. All solutions posted would be
hidden to allow users to come up with their own solutions. On the 21st
of the month, all the solutions will be thrown open for everyone to see
and comment upon. No new solutions will be accepted from 21st onwards.
The cycle begins again on the 1st of the following month. The Ruby
working solution(s) should be clear-cut, follow Ruby conventions and
still be easy to understand.

How does RPCFN benefit you?
---------------------------

[Chris
Strom](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/15/chris-strom-how-do-i-learn-and-master-sinatra/)
([twitter](http://twitter.com/eee_c "twitter") / [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20140427193020/http://japhr.blogspot.com/ "blog"))
is one of the problem setters for the RPCFN and has this to say:

> RPCFN is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take
> you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to
> use the language. RPCFN provides a fabulous forum for using Ruby in
> the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges.
> Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Ruby well, as each
> fortnight the best solution to a challenge is chosen. RPCFN is a
> wonderful introduction to the Ruby language and to the Ruby community.
> Welcome newbies!

Challenge Rules
---------------

To participate in the RPCFN, you must be at least 18 years old. The
Challenge is open to individuals.

Each entrant shall indemnify, defend, and hold RubyLearning harmless
from any third party claims arising from or related to that entrant’s
participation in the Challenge. In no event shall RubyLearning be liable
to an entrant for acts or omissions arising out of or related to the
Challenge or that entrant’s participation in the Challenge.

Odds of winning depend on the number and quality of entries received.
All taxes, including income taxes, are the sole responsibility of
winners. No prize substitution is permitted. Winner(s) may be required
to verify their entry.

Notification
------------

The winning entries will be announced on the [RubyLearning
blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20140427193020/http://rubylearning.com/blog/).
The winners will be sent their prizes by email.

Best Solution
-------------

![Best
Solution](./Ruby%20Programming%20Challenge%20For%20Newbies%20FAQ_files/idea.png)

The author of the RPCFN for the particular month will decide the best
solution, with some help from RubyLearning. This panel shall have the
sole authority and discretion to select the award recipient(s).

Prizes
------

There will normally be two prizes (though we reserve the right to change
this for each challenge). One prize will go for the best solution (if
there is a tie between answers, then the one who posted first will be
the winner) and the other will be decided by randomly selecting one
person from all the remaining working solutions for that month. If a
person wins he/she can’t win again in the next, immediate challenge but
can still participate. Prizes can range from small cash rewards to free
pdfs – whatever the sponsors of the challenge have offered.

Can I Submit A Ruby Programming Challenge Topic?
------------------------------------------------

**Please do!** Ruby Programming Challenge depends on community support.
The challenge problem statement should be easily understood by Ruby
newbies but complex enough for it to be fun
![;-)](./Ruby%20Programming%20Challenge%20For%20Newbies%20FAQ_files/icon_wink.gif)
Let the challenge be both obvious and.. challenging. A hard combo! This
is obviously vague, so use your best judgment. Send all submissions to
[Satish Talim](mailto:satish.talim@gmail.com). Feel free to submit as
often as you like.

Can I make a donation?
----------------------

**Absolutely!** RPCFN is entirely financed by RubyLearning and sometimes
sponsors, so if you have enjoyed the problems and would like to give
something back by helping with the running costs then any donations are
gratefully received.

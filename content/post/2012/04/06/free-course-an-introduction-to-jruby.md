    According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby</a> &#8211; &#8220;JRuby is a Java implementation of the Ruby programming language, being developed by the JRuby team. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code.&#8221;

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Despite all the new alternatives, JRuby on Rails remains one of the fastest, cleanest ways to build JVM-based web applications. JRuby provides the full Ruby ecosystem as well as integration with JVM languages and libraries. Ruby is both a wonderful language and increasingly the best choice for rapid application development. Add to that platforms like Torquebox and the excellent Ruby community, and it&#8217;s easy to see why JRuby should be in every Java developer&#8217;s toolbox.

  <h3>
    Who&#8217;s It For?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>A <em>beginner</em> but with a working knowledge of Ruby and Java</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This course will not teach you Java or Ruby programming. A basic knowledge of both programming languages is assumed, but most examples will be in Ruby and focus on Ruby development with help from Java. Also, you should have played around with some database. <em>Whether you are a Java hacker who&#8217;s new to Ruby or a Rubyist taking your first steps into Java, this course is a great guide to help you navigate the gray area between the new languages</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By the time you have finished the course and worked on the examples and assignments, you will be fairly comfortable with JRuby.

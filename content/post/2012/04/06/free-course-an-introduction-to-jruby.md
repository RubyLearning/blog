According to
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby)
– “JRuby is a Java implementation of the Ruby programming language,
being developed by the JRuby team. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java
to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with
full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code.”

**[Charles Nutter](https://twitter.com/#!/headius)** says -

> Despite all the new alternatives, JRuby on Rails remains one of the
> fastest, cleanest ways to build JVM-based web applications. JRuby
> provides the full Ruby ecosystem as well as integration with JVM
> languages and libraries. Ruby is both a wonderful language and
> increasingly the best choice for rapid application development. Add to
> that platforms like Torquebox and the excellent Ruby community, and
> it’s easy to see why JRuby should be in every Java developer’s
> toolbox.

-   jruby03.rb – Swing library
-   Extending Java

## Who’s It For?

**A *beginner* but with a working knowledge of Ruby and Java**.

This course will not teach you Java or Ruby programming. A basic
knowledge of both programming languages is assumed, but most examples
will be in Ruby and focus on Ruby development with help from Java. Also,
you should have played around with some database. *Whether you are a
Java hacker who’s new to Ruby or a Rubyist taking your first steps into
Java, this course is a great guide to help you navigate the gray area
between the new languages*.

By the time you have finished the course and worked on the examples and
assignments, you will be fairly comfortable with JRuby.

## Mentors

[Satish Talim](http://satishtalim.com/) and others from the RubyLearning
team.

## Dates

The course starts on Saturday, 12th May 2012 and runs for a week.

## How do I register?

Register [here](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=68).

Hurry, registrations have started.

At the end of this course you should have enough working knowledge to
explore the wonderful world of JRuby, on your own.

Here are some details on how the course works:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Someone shall always be there to answer them. Just to set the
expectations correctly, there is no real-time ‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some extra
    notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class reading material
    at a convenient time of your choice – the dates mentioned are just
    for your guideline. While reading, please make a note of all your
    doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments about the
    lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post these on the
    forum **under the relevant lesson**. There could be some questions
    that relate to something that has not been mentioned or discussed by
    the mentors thus far; you could post the same too. Please remember
    that with every post, do mention the operating system of your
    computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that day’s session.
-   There could be exercises every day. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas among
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. Please be aware that these messages are considered noises
    by people subscribed to the forum.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  Most of the days, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help you assimilate whatever you have learned till then.
2.  Some days may have some extra assignments / food for thought
    articles / programs
3.  **Above all, do take part in the relevant forums. Past participants
    will confirm that they learned the best by active participation.**

    that is relevant to the class / lesson. Past participants will
    confirm that they learned the best by active participation.
-   **Qs.** How much time do I need to spend online for a course, in a

    comfort level and the amount of time you want to spend on a
    particular lesson or task.
-   **Qs.** Is there any specific set time for feedback (e.g., any

-   **Qs.** What happens to the class (or forums) after a course is
    over? Can you keep it open for a few more days so that students can
    complete and discuss too?\
    **Ans.** The course and its forum is open for a month after the last
    day of the course.

Remember, the idea is to have fun learning JRuby.

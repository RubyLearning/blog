  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">R</span>egistrations are now open for RubyLearning&#8217;s popular Ruby programming course. This is an intensive, online course for <em>beginners</em> that helps you get started with <strong>Ruby</strong> programming.
  </p>
  
  <p class="update">
    Here is what <b>Demetris Demetriou</b>, a participant who just graduated, has to say &#8211; &#8220;When I joined this course I was sceptical about how useful this course would be for me instead of reading material and watching videos on YouTube and thus saving money. After the course started I realised how valuable this course was. In the past I had read many Ruby books over and over, but never got into really getting practical with it and never had confidence in it. Lots of theory but couldn&#8217;t use it. I feel that the exercises in this course and the support, monitoring from our mentor Victor, made the huge difference that all books in the past didn&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t about reading lots of books, but simply few things and get practical and understand them well. I feel I learnt a lot and I&#8217;m coming back for more to rubylearning.org Thanks a lot Victor and Satish and all the other Rubyists who gave us today&#8217;s Ruby.&#8221;

  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/</a> &#8211; &#8220;Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Ruby&#8217;s elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to write.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Yukihiro Matsumoto</b>, the creator of Ruby, in <b><a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">an interview</a></b> says -
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They don&#8217;t want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    What Will I Learn?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html">essential features of Ruby</a> that you will end up using every day. You will also be introduced to Git, GitHub, HTTP concepts, RubyGems, Rack and Heroku.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding challenge in the mix, right for the level we are at. We have been known to give out a prize or two for the &#8216;best&#8217; solution.

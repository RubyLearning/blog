I got the opportunity to review [Exploring Everyday Things with R and Ruby](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022626.do)
by Sau Sheong Chang and published by O’Reilly Media^[1](#fn-6609-1)^

 This book, as expected, talks about R and Ruby. The first chapters cover
 Ruby at an introductory level.

 In the first chapter, after showing how you can install Ruby and an
 introduction to the basics of Ruby, he also provides “a quick
 introduction to Shoes, a simple but powerful UI toolkit for
 Ruby”^[2](#fn-6609-2)^, with installation suggestions and sample code.

 His introduction to Ruby covers the basics and is just a bit more than
 enough to understand the code in the rest of his book. I think he did a
 really good job of that. The second part of the first chapter, covering
 Shoes, explains Shoes in a nutshell rather well, I think. You will get
 to use Shoes in later chapters.

 He then goes on to introduce R, which I had not used before. He covers
 in a way that was fairly straightforward to install and get running.
 Within a few moments, I had R installed and the ‘normal’ graphical tools
 up and running and was able to run some sample code, and even had graphs
 floating around my screen based on data that I created from the samples.

 Shortly after that, I had R code being created in my favorite text
 editor, and executing code right from there.

 His introduction to the language is fairly quick, but again, just a bit
 more than enough to get you going.

 He also covers some statistical transformation examples to change the
 statistical data into plottable information. That is a good thing,
 because throughout the book, you will be needing to recognize this in
 the examples, and will have fun producing your own graphical
 representations of data you get.

 And all that is enough to get you started creating models to solve real
 world problems.

 For example, do you need to convince your boss that you need more
 restrooms available for the people in your office? You can provide some
 simulations and reports and graphs (the boss likes graphs, right?) to
 support your argument, or will it support his assertion that what you
 have is just the right amount?

 This gets to the fun part. Have you ever wondered how to mine data from
 your own e-mail? To find trends of when you send mail, or who you
 communicate with most? Finding the most often used words and the
 trending themes in your communications? You are in luck. He will take
 you through the Enron Saga to lightly touch on analyzing that e-mail
 data^[3](#fn-6609-3)^, but easily apply it to your own IMAP e-mail
 accounts.

 How about biometrics, recording your own heartbeat through a home-made
 electronic stethoscope? Yes, you will be able to do this, and take
 measurements, and analyze them graphically. Combine that with pulse
 oximetry with your webcam and you might have just enough evidence to
 convince your boss that your cubicle is suffocating you.

 That sounds fun enough, but it will involve analyzing sound files and
 video files to get the readings and measurements that you want to
 produce in a graphical chart. That makes it fun to the nth power, right?

 Well, what can be more fun than Boid’s… and boid **is** the
 woid^[4](#fn-6609-4)^ in this next chapter. Using Ruby Shoes you will
 explore the flocking of birds, you will write a simulation and are
 encouraged to continue playing on.

 What follows is an extension of the Boids and introduces the mortality
 and procreation of the boids, which were prior to this immortals in a
 veritable utopia. Life simulated and analyzed.

 Overall, I really enjoyed this book, it was easy to read, had some math
 in it, of course, but nothing that requires advanced math. And the
 topics were fun to work through. And there is plenty of room to
 experiment and explore after finishing the chapters.

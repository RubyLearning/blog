    Nag. B is the brain behind <strong><a href="http://startups.in/" >Startups.in</a></strong>. Startups.in simplifies the establishment of startups through a collaborative approach that is a win-win situation to all the involved members. I&#8217;ve invited Nag to share some of his experiences in this interview.

    <strong>Could you tell us something about yourself &#8211; your background, where you are based&#8230;?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Satish, thank you very much for your interest in <a href="http://startups.in/" >Startups.in</a> and I appreciate you taking time in featuring us on your highly regarded site.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So far, I&#8217;m yet another Indian currently based in US. I work for a company that provides offerings to create the Internet solutions and enables people to make powerful connections.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Personally, I also have a deep passion and a strong fascination about startups and entrepreneurship and <a href="http://startups.in/India" >Startups.in/India</a> is an outlet to share these interests with others.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Could you tell us a little more about Startups.in?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As with any other venture it all started with an idea. In this case, the idea was to bring to fore the spirit of entrepreneurship in India and provide a common platform to connect startups, more specifically, startups in India. <a href="http://startups.in/India" >Startups.in/India</a> is the first step towards realizing that idea.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The venture has been active for less than an year now and the focus so far has been to feature startups in India with two primary goals -
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      help spread the word out to the world about the startups in India and
    </li>
    <li>
      help the future entrepreneurs learn from the experiences of the seasoned entrepreneurs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Based on the feedback being received and looking at the way Startups.in/India is molding itself, I believe we are on the right track to meet our goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://startups.in/" >Startups.in</a> is a central site that binds all other value add-in applications and other sites like:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://jobs.startups.in/" >Startups.in/Jobs</a> &#8211; a free job posting site
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://videos.startups.in/" >Startups.in/Videos</a> &#8211; a collection of educational videos highlighting entrepreneurship and technology etc., in addition to others.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Why did you decide to use Ruby on Rails (RoR) for this site?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As any other web based project developer, I too would prefer a framework that would allow us to churn better software which is easy to maintain with a quick turnaround time. I believe any framework that can meet these requirements would not only be a efficient choice but would also be &#8220;cost effective&#8221; for bootstrapped startups.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While I&#8217;m not an authority on web application frameworks, I&#8217;ve been keenly following the discussions on various websites and RoR seems to fit my requirements very well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Again, this is coming from some one who did not have a first hand experience at RoR and I therefore have started seeking expert advice from well respected professionals like you who have been in this Industry for a long time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>What&#8217;s your impression about the RoR scene in India?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I will not claim much expertise here but from whatever I&#8217;ve been reading and following through the media, RoR as a whole still has a long to way before it goes mainstream and experiences a higher adoption rate. As far as RoR scene in India is concerned, the &#8220;scene&#8221; is still in its &#8220;opening act&#8221; and the &#8220;rail&#8221; is yet to pick up the &#8220;steam&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But given its obvious advantages and with efforts from evangelists like you, I&#8217;m sure RoR will be on the express track very soon across India with <strong>Pune</strong> as its hub.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>What are your future plans for Startups.in?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    More than highlighting the products/services, <a href="http://startups.in/India" >Startups.in/India</a> is about entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit behind these startups in India. In my personal opinion what really deserves a focus is not just the startups but the passionate entrepreneurs driving them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While we will continue to drive <a href="http://startups.in/India" >Startups.in/India</a> with that focus, we will also continue to explore, innovate and offer better ways to help startups. <a href="http://startu.ps/" >Startu.ps</a> will be our launch pad.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks once again for the opportunity, Satish.

    <strong>Information</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are many sites and blogs that conduct free <a href="http://www.thehostplanet.com/reviews/reviews.html">hosting reviews</a>. If you are interested in getting you own <a href="http://www.registeranydomain.com">domain name</a> you should take a look at these reviews. Also there are many things to consider while getting a hosting plan. Like many hosting companies offer free services along with their hosting plans e.g. <a href="http://www.performanceppc.com/Affiliate-Marketing/">affiliate marketing</a>, web templates, <a href="http://www.1-hit.com/free-search-engine-submit.php">search engine submission</a> but on the other side they are not that good at taking backups etc. They are trying to cover this discrepancy by offering free services; <a href="http://www.complete-website-hosting.com/review-startlogic.htm">startlogic</a> offers quality web hosting in this context. Also many <a href="http://www.ispsushi.com">isp</a> now offer the services of web hosting and some offer <a href="http://www.cableunplugged.com">free wireless internet</a> along with taking hosing plan from them.

[Jeremy Durhamâ€™s blog](http://www.jeremydurham.com/) talks about an open
source software framework for scalable cross-language services
development, named [Thrift](http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/). It
combines a powerful software stack with a code generation engine to
build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java,
Python, PHP, and Ruby. Thrift was developed at Facebook. Have a look.

Please be aware that there are many companies in India claiming to be
working on ROR; be doubly sure!

* * * * *

Look up some [India
timeshares](http://www.sellmytimesharenow.com/India-timeshare.html) if
you plan on visiting.
[Timeshares](http://recenter.tamu.edu/links/linksSearch.asp?cid=248) can
be a great way to stay in a foreign land and [India
timeshares](http://www.sellmytimesharenow.com/searchrent.php?crt=on&country=102&unitType=&bathrooms=&week=)
are no exception.\

* * * * *

Also please feel free to comment and suggest other Indian companies
working on ROR (with their URLs), that you may have come across.

**Update:**

-   In response to Fabio Akita’s comment, it is my opinion that most
    companies are still in the experimentation stage and / or executing
    small ROR based projects.
-   Thanks to Ajay Kumar for some more company names.

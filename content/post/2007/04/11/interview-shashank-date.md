    <span style="color:blue;">(This interview appeared before on 28th Aug. 2006 on the PuneRuby blog).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today we talk to our own Ruby Guru, <b><span style="color:blue;">Shashank Date</span></b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Hello Shashank, and welcome to PuneRuby. Could you tell us something about yourself &#8211; your background; where you are based&#8230;?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Unlike the other gurus interviewed before me, I hail from Pune and am glad to be an active member of <b>PuneRuby</b>. I did my Masters (MCA) in Computer Applications from Pune University in 1987 and worked in various organizations in India (notably C-DAC) till 1994. I immigrated to the U.S. in 1994 and have been in Overland Park, Kansas since then. For the past 12 years, I have worked as a consultant to various Fortune 500 companies. I am curently a freelancer (thanks to Ruby on Rails) and also the founder of <b><a href="http://www.reevik.com" >Reevik Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</a></b>, a Pune based company also focused on web application development and mobile application development.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Given the choices out there, why did you select Ruby?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Back in March 2002, I was looking for a scripting solution to address a temporary requirement of writing a query parallelizer for a (closed source) system I was working on. I accidently came across the PickAxe book and found a very neat thread based solution which almost matched my needs. I immediately set forth to investigate further and as I dug deeper into Ruby, fell in love with the language and the community. I did not feel like investigating more options to choose from.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> How did you learn Ruby and when?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Most of the Ruby I Iearnt is self taught with kind, patient support from many gurus in the community (too many to mention), often no less than Matz himself. I also owe a lot to the authors of these fine books: &#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221; (a.k.a PickAxe), &#8220;The Ruby Way&#8221; and &#8220;Learn Ruby in 21 days&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Which features of Ruby do you like the most?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Blocks, dynamism and syntax sugar make Ruby shine!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Do you think Ruby has the potential to be a mainstream programming language?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Purely from the technical standpoint, absolutely! But for a language to become mainstream, there needs to be a socio-political pressure. Fortunately, that pressure has been built up by the pre-eminent web application framework &#8220;Ruby on Rails&#8221;, and judging by the number of companies both big and small looking at it seriously makes me believe that the tipping point has been achieved.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> What applications, utilities have you developed in Ruby and what platform are you running these applications on?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> All my Ruby applications and utilities have been on the Windows platform out of necessity, not choice. As mentioned earlier, I had developed a library which helped parallelizing queries to MS SQL Server 2000 which remains closed source. I have also written a library to shallow parse t-SQL, a utility to interface the Windows scheduler, a library to interface Lego Mindstorms Robotics Kit, all of which are in the open source on RubyForge. I am member of the one-click installer team for Windows and the win32-utils team, both of which are one of the most downloaded packages in the Ruby world.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Anything else you would like to share with the PuneRuby members?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Shashank Date>></b> Yes, back in May 2005 when I had visited Pune, I had lamented the fact that there is no PuneRuby Users Group and discussed the idea of sponsoring such an activity. I am thrilled to see that you spearheaded that effort and now claim to have the largest Ruby Users Group around. Congratulations and keep up the good work!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Thanks Shashank Date for sharing your views with the PuneRuby members.

  <p>
    Today we talk to <b><span style="color:blue;">Elliot Temple</span></b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Hello Elliot, and welcome to PuneRuby. Could you tell us something about yourself &#8211; your background; where you are based&#8230;?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> I am in Berkeley, California. I&#8217;ve programmed on and off since I was 13 when I learned Scheme and C++. I&#8217;ve done contract programming work for the last two years, mostly for <b><a href="http://www.cybergroup.com/" >Cybergroup</a></b>. My interests include epistemology, <b><a href="http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/" >parenting</a></b>, and <b><a href="http://www.settingtheworldtorights.com/" >politics</a></b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Given the choices out there, why did you select Ruby?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> I think Lisp has the best philosophical underpinnings of any language, but Ruby is specialized better for the kinds of programs most people write today. Of the high-level, convenient-to-use, modern languages with good libraries, Ruby has some of the best abstraction and meta-programming features. And it&#8217;s nicer to use than its competitors due to better syntax, blocks, the principle of least surprise, and the principle of letting the user have freedom. Or maybe it&#8217;s nice because Matz is a genius. Ruby also has Rails.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> How did you learn Ruby and when?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> I started seriously learning Ruby four months ago (May 2006). I got Programming Ruby 2nd ed and just started using Ruby (for the Ruby Quiz and some scripts) and looked up whatever I needed. Answering questions in the IRC room and on the mailing list is a good way to practice Ruby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Which features of Ruby do you like the most?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> I like being able to re-open classes, method_missing, that everything is an object, the standard library, that Hash and Array are feature-rich, and blocks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Do you think Ruby has the potential to be a mainstream programming language?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> Yes of course. Ruby is good, computers keep getting faster, and people are coming to realize more and more that high-level languages are worth the the tradeoffs. And Ruby has a good community that&#8217;s capable of improving Ruby as time goes on.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> What applications, utilities have you developed in Ruby and what platform are you running these applications on?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> I wrote some scripts and I&#8217;ve mostly completed a Tetris program, but I haven&#8217;t done anything big in Ruby yet. I&#8217;m writing a Balanced Scorecard Rails application. I develop Ruby programs on Mac OS X with Textmate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Anything else you would like to share with the PuneRuby members?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Elliot Temple>></b> If you don&#8217;t know about Unit Tests, you should. They let you be more confident your code works, and make it less stressful to change things. Here&#8217;s the <b><a href="http://grayproductions.net/ruby/first_steps.html" >best introduction to Unit Testing</a></b> I&#8217;ve seen.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Satish Talim>></b> Thanks Elliot for sharing your views with the PuneRuby members. You can keep in touch with Elliot via his <b><a href="http://www.curi.us/blog/">blog</a></b>.

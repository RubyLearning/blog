[ColourCode](http://22bits.exofire.net/browse/code/colourcode) is a
syntax highlighter. It can read in a source file and generate a
syntax-highlighted version in various formats. ColourCode is written in
Ruby and licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2. The author, Nikhil
Marathe is based in Mumbai and is in the 12th grade. It is really
encouraging to find someone so young and in India, putting his Ruby
knowledge to good use. All the best Nikhil.

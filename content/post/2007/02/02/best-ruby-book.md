An excellent blog post by [Peter
Szinek](http://www.rubyrailways.com/book-review-ruby-cookbook/) got me
thinking on my choice of the **Best Ruby Books** for the year 2006.

Hereâ€™s my list:

1.  [Ruby for Rails](http://www.manning.com/black/) by David A. Black
2.  [The Ruby
    Way](http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0672328844&rl=1)
    by Hal Fulton
3.  [Programming Ruby](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0974514055/) by
    Chad Fowler, Andy Hunt
4.  [Ruby Cookbook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/index.html)
    by Lucas Carlson, Leonard Richardson

What is your personal opinion and your choice of books?

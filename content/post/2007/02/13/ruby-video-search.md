I thought I would let you know that I have added Google AJAX Search on
my **[Learning
Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/other/ruby_video_search.html)** site. This
embeds a video bar on the web page and lets you watch Ruby and Rails
related videos (presentations, tutorials, etc.) youâ€™ve selected, right
there on the site itself. Have fun!<!--more-->

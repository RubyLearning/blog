title: How has Ruby blown my mind?
---

[Ruby Code
blocks](http://sitekreator.com/satishtalim/blocks_and_procs.html) – This
single language feature in Ruby, has changed the way I think about code.
Blocks (called *closures* in other languages) are definitely, for me,
one of the coolest features of Ruby.

Will we have [closures in Java
1.7](http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2006/08/will_we_have_closures_in_java.html)
? I hope we do.

Another subtle feature, though not obvious, is that **Ruby** has revived
the programmer in me.

By the way, if you don’t know about [Apress’](http://www.apress.com/)

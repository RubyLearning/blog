ED4W is a full featured Programmer's Editor/IDE with support<!--more--> for 30+
languages. It includes all of the editing capabilities you would expect,
plus a built-in Source Database Engine that tracks every class, method,
module, struct etc. in real time enabling you to instantly jump to any
function etc. and making navigation of large complex code bases much
easier.

For business email many go with [Exchange email
outsourcing](http://www.intermedia.net/about-us/news/2007/exchange-2007-for-mid-sized-companies.asp)
to handle their issues. A good [Microsoft
Exchange](http://it.med.miami.edu/x294.xml) solution is useful even for
colleges, so consider outsourcing or hosting your own [Microsoft
Exchange
server](http://www.intermedia.net/it-professionals/hosted-exchange/hosted-exchange.asp)
for business email needs.\

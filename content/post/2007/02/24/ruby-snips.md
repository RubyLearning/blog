[Robert Evans](http://www.puneruby.com/blog/?p=94) has come up with the
**[Ruby Snips](http://rubysnips.com/)** site. In his words:<!--more-->

> Ruby Snips is an idea that I've had for a while, but only recently
> have put together in my mind. I love Code Snippets, formerly owned by
> Peter Cooper, but I've always found myself wishing to be able to
> search the snippets easily and have a semi-brief explanation of the
> snippet being displayed.
>
> Another aspect that has brought about this site is that I am always
> learning new things that can be done with Ruby and I'd like to have a
> centralized place of snippets with explanations and thoughts for
> myself and for anyone else learning Ruby. This site isn't terribly
> unique in any sense, but rather another resource for the Ruby
> community.

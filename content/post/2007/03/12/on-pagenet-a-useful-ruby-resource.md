How many times have you ever needed to find just one argument of a Ruby
method/function/operator or just some word of syntax while working?

The first thing you have to do is to google it or to use the index of
.chm or just Ctrl+F through some manuals or pages… and as a result you
have a lot of garbage and you need to search again for some useful
sample or description.

On-page.net is an attempt to reduce the garbage and give to you just
what you really need.

The idea is this: only one page with information blocks. Each block can
describe from one to a few keywords. All the keywords are marked
(indexed) by block creator (No machine index and search! Closer to Web
3.0). Every visitor can add, modify and/or delete a block, but all
changes will be pre-moderated.

As a result, you have a page where you can find a useful sample or a
description of any keyword or symbol, just by typing it right in your
browser. You don't even need to use Ctrl+F… and you can navigate between
keyword places via arrows or F3.

Ruby.on-page.net is just the beginning of new level of online help. For
now it is just a beta version of the engine and for only one language –
Ruby (includes just some scraps from "Programming Rubyi"). Now the
author is trying to improve the functionality, stability and performance
of the interface. Also, it must work cross-browser and support many
languages and localizations. What he really needs now is your advice and
ideas, or any feedback that can help him make it better and useful. Try
not to concentrate on bugs and errors, but think about what is good and
what is bad.

You can mail him (des7ign@gmail.com) or you can use the feedback form on
the site's page.

And you can try it right **[there](http://ruby.on-page.net)** (for now
just in Firefox).

    Recently, <a href="http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/ruby_experts_whythey_are_in">odinjobs</a> talked to a panel of Ruby Experts and asked them &#8220;Why they were in love with Ruby?&#8221; Peter Cooper, Alex Wayne, Alex Leverington, Abhay Kumar, Adam Williams, Alex Kane and Adam Keys were the panel of experts. Surprisingly, they included me too in this panel !!

---

Recently,
[odinjobs](http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/ruby_experts_whythey_are_in)
talked to a panel of Ruby Experts and asked them <!--more-->“Why they were in love
with Ruby?” Peter Cooper, Alex Wayne, Alex Leverington, Abhay Kumar,
Adam Williams, Alex Kane and Adam Keys were the panel of experts.
Surprisingly, they included me too in this panel !!

Recently, Pragmatic Programmer Dave Thomas, author of the ‘Pickaxe book’
Programming Ruby, and co-author of Agile Web Development with Rails and
The Pragmatic Programmer, talked with InfoQ about Ruby, Rails and the
importance of choosing the right tool for the job.<!--more-->

The quote that made my day was when Dave was asked: “Why does coding in
Ruby make you happy?” and Dave answered: “*Coding in Ruby makes me happy
because it’s one of the shortest paths between my brain and a computer.
I can think of something and I can express it very succinctly and
typically fairly elegantly in Ruby without all the kind of extraneous
fluff that you need in most other languages, and that makes me happy. It
also makes me happy because I like playing and I like trying new things
out and I like experimenting: ‘Does this work?’ and Ruby has sufficient
depth that I can do that. I am still learning new things about Ruby
every day and that is good fun, so it makes me happy because I can be
productive, but also makes me happy because I learn while I am using it,
it’s just not static.*“

Yes Dave there are thousands of such happy Ruby programmers out there
and Matz and you made that happen for us.

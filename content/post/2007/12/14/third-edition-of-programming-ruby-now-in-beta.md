  <p>
    Dave Thomas just announced that the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3">Third Edition</a> of the PickAxe has just entered beta. Each edition of the book tracks the latest Ruby release, and each is the definitive reference to Ruby. This third edition maintains that tradition, and has been updated to reflect the new features of Ruby 1.9.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In Dave&#8217;s words, here&#8217;s the plan. &#8220;I&#8217;m starting with the second edition text and going through it revising for 1.9 changes. So far I&#8217;m done the first 120 pages or so. When you look at the beta book, you&#8217;ll see some pages with red headers and footers, and others with gray. The red pages are updated content, and the gray pages are content from the second edition. Over time, more and more pages will turn red, until the book is done.

    Matz is still making changes to 1.9 functionality. This book will track these changes, so that it will mirror what 1.9 becomes as we move towards an eventual release. We won&#8217;t go to press until Ruby has stabilized.&#8221;

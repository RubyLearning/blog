Dave Thomas just announced that the [Third
Edition](http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3) of the PickAxe has just
entered beta. Each edition of the book tracks the latest Ruby release,
and each is the definitive reference to Ruby. This third edition
maintains that tradition, and has been updated to reflect the new
features of Ruby 1.9.<!--more-->

In Dave’s words, here’s the plan. “I’m starting with the second edition
text and going through it revising for 1.9 changes. So far I’m done the
first 120 pages or so. When you look at the beta book, you’ll see some
pages with red headers and footers, and others with gray. The red pages
are updated content, and the gray pages are content from the second
edition. Over time, more and more pages will turn red, until the book is
done.

Matz is still making changes to 1.9 functionality. This book will track
these changes, so that it will mirror what 1.9 becomes as we move
towards an eventual release. We won’t go to press until Ruby has
stabilized.”

The **[Learning Ruby Job
Board](http://rubylearning.com/jobs/ruby_jobs.html)** is getting a very
good response from the Ruby and Rails readers of
[RubyLearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/).

Two new job posts need mention here:

-   **[DormAid, NY,
    USA](http://learningruby.jobcoin.com/jobs/show/27959-college-age-junior-developer-designer)**
    – DormAid is a college service company operating at over 40 major
    campuses. They are planning to extend their cutting edge web
    applications to interact with tech-savvy students in more
    interesting ways. They are looking for college-age web
    developers/designers who know Ruby on Rails or are willing to learn.
-   **[Codeweavers Ltd,
    UK](http://learningruby.jobcoin.com/jobs/show/28612-web-application-developer)**
    – They are looking to recruit a developer to work on an existing
    project built using Rails, RSpec and PostgreSQL. The site is in its
    early stages and will likely expand rapidly. They are equally happy
    to take on junior as well as experienced developers.

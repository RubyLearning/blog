It’s an honor for me as Richard Piacentini and Mathieu Fosse have agreed
to translate my Ruby Study Notes in French.

**Richard Piacentini** is a French Rails enthusiast and evangelist. He
and his friend Laurent Julliard did the [French
Adaption](http://www.editions-eyrolles.com/Livre/9782212120790/) of the
book “Agile Web Development with Rails.” He is the creator of
[RailsFrance.org](http://www.railsfrance.org/). He is currently busy
organizing the [Paris on Rails 2007](http://paris.onrails.info/)
conference.

**[Mathieu Fosse](http://blog.kawooa.org/)** is also a French Rails
enthusiast.

I am looking forward to the French version of the Ruby Study Notes.

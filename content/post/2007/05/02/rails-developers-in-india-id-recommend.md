title: Rails Developers in India, I'd Recommend
---

Like [Peter
Cooper](http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-developers-id-recommend-for-your-projects-467.html),
I too constantly get emails from various readers of
[RubyLearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/), who are looking for
**Rails developers in India** for their projects. As I don’t do this
myself, I have to keep giving out a list of Rails developers I know and
trust or have had good feedback about.<!--more-->

My previous blog post [Ruby on Rails in
India](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/04/24/ruby-on-rails-in-india/)
just lists down all the companies working in Rails in India.

Here, I am listing down companies (in no particular order) I’d recommend
and will keep it updated as a resource for everyone to use.

If you have worked with any of these companies or with some company not
listed here, *please do comment about your experience and why you would
recommend or not recommend that company.*.

*(Disclaimer: None of these companies has ever paid me anything and none
requested this post.. just to be clear!)*

1.  **[Blue Whale Labs](http://www.bluewhalelabs.com/)** (Contact
    Person: [Ranvir Gujral](mailto:ranvir@bluewhalelabs.com)), Delhi
    provides strategic consulting, conceptualization, design, and
    development for innovative social applications. They have an
    extensive history in usability, user experience, design, and web
    application development. They couple that expertise with deep and
    current technology domain knowledge to satisfy complex client
    requirements. They also provide a thorough understanding of
    business, operations, and, most importantly, how to launch robust
    web applications from scratch with limited time and budget.\
    The Blue Whale team is led by seasoned social software architects
    and strategists. They bring specific end-to-end knowledge of the
    challenges that face today’s emerging and established social
    application providers. Blue Whale Labs was founded on the premise
    that social application providers are best served by a firm that
    completely understands and can deliver upon the emerging social
    technology topology.
2.  **[BetterLabs](http://www.betterlabs.net/)** (Contact Person:
    [Vaibhav Domkundwar](mailto:vaibhav.domkundwar@betterlabs.net)),
    Pune is a product development company focused on building products
    that address critical pain points and deliver an easy and simple
    user experience. Their products fall in the consumer Internet and
    web-based business application segments. At BetterLabs, they have
    created an unique model for new product development where they build
    products and aim to take them through the first 12-18 months to
    demonstrate a successful revenue model, at which point, such
    products may be spun out. They use this model for their internal
    product development and work with very early stage Silicon Valley
    startup founders to build their product from the concept stage to go
    live, acting as their product development team. They primarily
    develop in **Ruby on Rails** and PHP. The products that they have
    delivered so far include:
    -   [dealplumber](http://www.dealplumber.com/)

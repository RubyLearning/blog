    Like <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-developers-id-recommend-for-your-projects-467.html" >Peter Cooper</a>, I too constantly get emails from various readers of <a href="http://rubylearning.com/" >RubyLearning.com</a>, who are looking for <strong>Rails developers in India</strong> for their projects. As I don&#8217;t do this myself, I have to keep giving out a list of Rails developers I know and trust or have had good feedback about.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My previous blog post <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/04/24/ruby-on-rails-in-india/" >Ruby on Rails in India</a> just lists down all the companies working in Rails in India.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here, I am listing down companies (in no particular order) I&#8217;d recommend and will keep it updated as a resource for everyone to use.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have worked with any of these companies or with some company not listed here, <i>please do comment about your experience and why you would recommend or not recommend that company.</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>(Disclaimer: None of these companies has ever paid me anything and none requested this post.. just to be clear!)</i>

title: 7 Things You Can Do With Ruby
---

So you want to do something with **Ruby** but think there’s not much you
can do? Rubbish! <!--more-->

Below is a list of just **7 things you can do with Ruby**.

1.  **Name your daughter or puppy Ruby** – [Peter
    Cooper](http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-becomes-4th-most-popular-girls-name-in-the-uk-341.html#comments)
    reports that Ruby has become the 4th most popular name in the UK!
    [Dan Kubb](http://autopilotmarketing.com/) named his puppy Ruby.
2.  **Draw Cartoons for Ruby** – whytheluckstiff popularized Ruby with
    his excellent cartooning ability in his book [Why’s (Poignant) Guide
    to Ruby](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/).
3.  **Become Famous using Ruby** – Build a ‘killer’ application using
    Ruby like [David
    Hansson](http://www.indicthreads.com/interviews/390/ruby_on_rails_java_web_application.html)
    did with ‘Ruby on Rails’.
4.  **Write a book on Ruby** – [Bruce
    Tate](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0976694093/index.html), [David
    Black](http://www.manning.com/black/), [Hal
    Fulton](http://www.samspublishing.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0672328844&rl=1),
    [James Edward Gray
    II](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_quiz/index.html),
    [Peter
    Cooper](http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10244) to
    name a few, have done it. If you have the knack and the knowledge,
    write one.
5.  **Build a business around Ruby** –
    [Peerant](http://peerant.com/technology/index.php?Itemid=3) amongst
    hundreds of other companies are doing it. Why not you?
6.  **Have fun** – My [RubyLearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/)
    site’s motto is – ‘Ruby helps programmers have more fun…’ Why not?
7.  **Blog about Ruby** – And finally like me, if you have nothing
    better to do, blog about Ruby!

**In conclusion:** I could go on and on (and I probably will)…

**Update:** The 7 Things can easily become 10 or 25 or 50 Things -

1.  **Teach Ruby** – Like I do at the University level.
2.  **Start a RUG** – I started a Ruby User Group –
    [PuneRuby](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/puneruby/). The
    experience has been satisfying.
3.  **Monetize your Ruby site/blog** – I use [Google
    Adsense](http://www.google.com/ads/). Atleast it covers my domain
    and hosting costs!

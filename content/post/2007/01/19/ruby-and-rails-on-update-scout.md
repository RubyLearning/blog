Ruby has just been added to
[Update-Scout.com](http://www.update-scout.com/index.html), an
interactive web service, that informs its users about software updates
and releases. Users can set up personal update news feeds from the
Update-Scout software catalog and even add new entries to the catalog.<!--more-->
It’s purpose is to support software users, who want to be informed about
new releases without having to constantly scan the publisher’s download
pages.

Max Kiesler has an excellent article.  The article presents the **Best Ruby
Guide**, tutorials, examples and downloads he has <!--more-->found over the
course of 2005-2006. He has spent numerous hours searching google, del.icio.us,
digg etc.. looking for usable and relevant Ruby examples. I do hope that Max
keeps updating this [invaluable
list.](http://www.maxkiesler.com/index.php/weblog/comments/learning_ruby_a_guide_to_online_tutorials_examples_and_downloads/)

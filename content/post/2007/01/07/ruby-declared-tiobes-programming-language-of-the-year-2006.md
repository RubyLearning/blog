[Curt
Hibbs](http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/01/ruby_declared_tiobes_programmi.html)
reports that **Ruby** is now in the top ten languages in the [TIOBE
index](http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm), and has been declared
**Programming Language of the Year for 2006** because it had the largest
popularity increase in 2006 of all the languages tracked.

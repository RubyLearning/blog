    In the early part of 2006, in my hometown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune">Pune</a>, everyone would associate Ruby with &#8216;<a href="http://www.gemsbiz.com/docs/ruby.asp">Ratnaraj</a>&#8216; or &#8220;king of precious stones&#8221; as per our ancient language of Sanskrit. Over the year things have changed, and the Ruby language and its famous framework Rails are seeing a huge surge of popularity here.

  <p>
    Pune is a city located in the western Indian state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. It is the 7th largest city in India with a population of 4.5 million, and the second largest in the state of Maharashtra. It is located roughly 120 kilometres east of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Mumbai</a> at an altitude of 560 metres above sea level.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pune has a reputation for its several esteemed colleges and educational institutions, a reason why it is called &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford">Oxford</a> of the East&#8217; (or &#8216;Oxford of India&#8217;). It has a very strong presence of the Automobile sector and is on its way to consolidate its position as the &#8216;Detroit of India&#8217; too. It is also home to many software and IT companies.

    A little over one year ago, <a href="http://dibya.wordpress.com/">Dibya Prakash</a> and I held the first meeting of the Ruby User Group of Pune &#8211; <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/puneruby/">PuneRuby</a>. This was attended by 25 people, mostly Java developers wanting to know more about this technology. PuneRuby has grown in strength with now over 400 members. <a href="http://sapforbusiness.com/">SAP for Business Ltd.</a> have been our main sponsors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Initially, <a href="http://reevik.com/">Reevik Technologies</a> was the only company working with Ruby and Rails. Today, every software company in Pune has started working in this technology. Big players like <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.co.in/index.html">Thoughtworks</a> and <a href="http://www.persistentsys.com/">Persistent Systems</a> are some of the prominent examples.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the ever growing need of Ruby and Rails personnel in Pune, a move in the right direction has been taken by <a href="http://www.puneruby.com/blog/?p=104">IIMM</a>, Pune. From Feb. 2007, IIMM have introduced Ruby and Rails for all their IT related courses.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the beginning of the year, none of the books on Ruby and Rails were available in Pune. Today, the <a href="http://www.puneruby.com/blog/?p=102">Indian reprints</a> of all these books are immediately available.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On a personal note, I had the good fortune to meet and talk to many <a href="http://sitekreator.com/satishtalim/ruby_gurus.html">Ruby Gurus</a> around the world via my interviews for PuneRuby. With their encouragement I published my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">Ruby Study Notes</a>, which finds mention on the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">Ruby Official site</a>. Recently, Dibya Prakash and I are in the process of forming our own software company &#8211; <a href="http://osconlab.com/">OsconLab</a> (Open Source Consulting Lab).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ruby is poised for growth and in the coming years you would hear a lot from the Rubyists in Pune.

Now-a-days many small (20-40 people) sized companies working with **Ruby
on Rails** in the US and Australia are planning to set-up their own
software units in Pune, India.<!--more-->

I have been helping some of these and I have penned down some of my
experiences.

*I am assuming that the foreign company has already worked out and
finalized their budgets and that they do not have a local presence.*

Here are the steps involved:

-   First, appoint a local consultant (LC) experienced in the entire
    process. Then make sure he has some business cards. This is
    essential as that person knows the local terrain and the rules and
    regulations of the city where the software unit is planned to be
    set-up.
-   There are many parallel activities that one needs to do. Today,
    let’s start talking about one of them, namely the process of
    incorporating the local company (normally a private limited
    company).

Amongst the various ways of achieving the objective of setting up an IT
company in India, I am suggesting one possible way:

-   Through your LC, appoint a local CPA (CA as they are known here).
-   To register a private company, you need a minimum of two resident
    Indians as Directors. If you know the LC well or have enough trust
    in him/her, appoint the LC as one of the Indian Directors.
-   The proposed Directors must have their DIN and DSC. This is in line
    with mandatory e-filing of all documents with the office of
    Registrar of Companies (ROC). The [Ministry of Company Affairs’
    site](http://www.mca.gov.in/) gives the full details. All the
    intending Directors have to obtain the Director Identification
    Number (DIN). The CPA can get a provisional DIN for you on the net
    within 10 minutes. Having done so, the CPA will save the provisional
    DIN form as a .pdf file, download it and then print the same. On the
    first page of the printed form, a photograph is to be affixed at the
    place provided and the proposed Director has to sign at two places,
    i.e. one below the photograph and the other at the bottom of the
    next page. Next, the CPA will take a photo-copy of the proposed
    Director’s proof of identity and proof of residence and send the
    printed form with the attached photo-copies to the Central DIN
    Processing Cell at NOIDA. The proposed Director will normally get
    the DIN approval letter within 15 days.**(\*)**
-   The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for use of Digital
    Signatures on the documents submitted in electronic form in order to
    ensure the security and authenticity of the documents filed
    electronically. This is the only secure and authentic way that a
    document can be submitted electronically. As such, all filings done
    by the companies under MCA21 e-Governance programme are required to
    be filed with the use of Digital Signatures by the person authorized
    to sign the documents. For this purpose a Digital Signature
    Certificate (DSC) is required. This process again could take between
    10-15 days. The approximate cost for DIN and DSC is Rs 3500-00 (Use
    [currency converter](http://www.xe.com/ucc/), if required). The DSC
    is normally valid for 2 years.

> It is very likely that one of the foreign national (FN) in the parent

> The FN also needs to get his DIN approved as per the process described

> **(\*)** The FN needs to take out photo-copies of his/her passport for
> proof of residence, get those photo-copies notarized in the USA and
> then a certification of those notarized copies is to be obtained from
> the official of the Indian Embassy in the USA. It’s advisable that the
> FN send all the necessary documents along with the notarized and
> certified documents to the CPA, who in turn can submit to the Central
> DIN Processing Cell at NOIDA.

-   The next step is getting the name of the proposed company approved
    from the office of ROC, which I will discuss in one of my next blog
    posts.

What has been your experience? Do you find the process very cumbersome
and time consuming? Are there any suggestions?

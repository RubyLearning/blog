**Rails** has made many changes from 1.1.6 to 1.2. Update your working copy to the latest version by going to your command prompt and entering:

<pre>gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org -y</pre>

Ensure that you are connected to the net and then your working copy would get updated. You should see something like this on your command prompt:

<pre>Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyonrails.org

Continuing with our series of blog posts with respect to ‘[Setting Up An
IT Company In
India](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/01/20/setting-up-an-it-company-in-india/)‘,
another parallel activity that you need to start is locating an office
space. <!--more-->

With the world making a beeline for Pune, Pune has become a home for
several large IT/ITES companies, automobile industries, banks and retail
brands. Here are some guidelines:

-   The availability of commercial office space is rather limited.
    However, do look around for space that has other IT companies
    near-by; easy accessibility to restaurants, hotels and residential
    area.
-   The rates for renting out (on lease) property (that has been fully
    furnished ie. pre-wired and interiors done up), are between Rs 80 to
    Rs. 90 per sq. ft. Also, there is a stamp duty to be paid on the
    payable rent.
-   Rates for bare, commercial office space range from Rs 40 to Rs 50
    per sq. ft.
-   Normally, 10 months rental is taken as security deposit.
-   Ensure that adequate parking space is provided.
-   You would have to add a few Rupees per sq. ft. for car parking per
    car, office maintenance, water, municipal corporation charges,
    security and diesel for generator.
-   The lock-in period varies from 3 to 5 years.
-   One noticeable problem is that these properties are usually a
    minimum of 8000 sq. ft. and above. Assuming 100 sq. ft. per
    developer, a 30 developer team would require around 3000 sq. ft. and
    it is really tough finding such commercial properties.
-   I would not recommend office space in residential areas as there are
    other problems like society permissions, reliable internet
    availability etc.
-   Some of the preferred commercial locations in Pune are Boat Club,
    Kalyani Nagar, Koregaon Park, Aundh and Baner.
-   Ask your LC to talk to a few real-estate agents for help in locating
    office space.

What has been your experience? Do you find the process very cumbersome
and time consuming? Are there any suggestions?

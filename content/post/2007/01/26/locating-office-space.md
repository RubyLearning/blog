    Continuing with our series of blog posts with respect to &#8216;<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/01/20/setting-up-an-it-company-in-india/" >Setting Up An IT Company In India</a>&#8216;, another parallel activity that you need to start is <span style="color:blue;">locating an office space.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the world making a beeline for Pune, Pune has become a home for several large IT/ITES companies, automobile industries, banks and retail brands. Here are some guidelines:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The availability of commercial office space is rather limited. However, do look around for space that has other IT companies near-by; easy accessibility to restaurants, hotels and residential area.
    </li>
    <li>
      The rates for renting out (on lease) property (that has been fully furnished ie. pre-wired and interiors done up), are between Rs 80 to Rs. 90 per sq. ft. Also, there is a stamp duty to be paid on the payable rent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rates for bare, commercial office space range from Rs 40 to Rs 50 per sq. ft.
    </li>
    <li>
      Normally, 10 months rental is taken as security deposit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that adequate parking space is provided.
    </li>
    <li>
      You would have to add a few Rupees per sq. ft. for car parking per car, office maintenance, water, municipal corporation charges, security and diesel for generator.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lock-in period varies from 3 to 5 years.
    </li>
    <li>
      One noticeable problem is that these properties are usually a minimum of 8000 sq. ft. and above. Assuming 100 sq. ft. per developer, a 30 developer team would require around 3000 sq. ft. and it is really tough finding such commercial properties.
    </li>
    <li>
      I would not recommend office space in residential areas as there are other problems like society permissions, reliable internet availability etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of the preferred commercial locations in Pune are Boat Club, Kalyani Nagar, Koregaon Park, Aundh and Baner.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask your LC to talk to a few real-estate agents for help in locating office space.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    What has been your experience? Do you find the process very cumbersome and time consuming? Are there any suggestions?

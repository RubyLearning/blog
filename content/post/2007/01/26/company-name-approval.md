title: Company Name Approval
---

So far in our series, we discussed the process of obtaining the DIN and
DSC for the proposed Directors. We can now start the process of company
name approval by the Registrar of Companies (ROC) in the State/Union
Territory in which the company will maintain its Registered Office. This
approval is provided subject to certain conditions:

-   There should not be an existing company by the same name.
-   Further, the last words in the name are required to be “Private
    Ltd.” in the case of a private company.
-   The application should mention at least four suitable names of the
    proposed company, in order of preference. In the case of a private
    limited company, the name of the company should end with the words
    “Private Limited” as the last words.
-   The applicant should ensure that he/she mentions in brief, the
    significance of the proposed names.
-   Also mention the main objective of the proposed company (ie.
    Business activity to be carried out).
-   Full information such as the personal details – Full name, Father’s
    full name, date of birth, residential address etc. is required for
    all the promoter Directors.
-   Remember, the minimum paid up share capital required for setting up
    a Private Company is Rs. 1 Lakh, with a minimum of two shareholders
    and two directors (who can be shareholders).
-   The ROC generally informs the applicant within three working days
    (by email) and within seven working days (by letter via speed post)
    from the date of submission of the application, whether or not any
    of the names applied for is available.
-   The approval letter is only for availability of name for the
    proposed company. The applicant cannot start business or enter into
    any agreement, contract etc. in the name of the proposed company,
    until and unless a certificate of registration is obtained.
-   Once a name is approved, it is valid for a period of six months,
    within which time Memorandum of Association and Articles of
    Association together with miscellaneous documents should be filed.
    If one is unable to do so, an application may be made for renewal of
    name by paying additional fees.
-   After obtaining the name approval, it normally takes approximately
    two to three weeks to incorporate a company depending on where the
    company is registered.
-   The cost involved for Company Name Approval (for Rs. 1 Lakh
    Authorised Capital) is around Rs 6500-00

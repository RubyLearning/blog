I have been asked time and again about ‘**Rails Hosting In India**‘ and
thought it best that I list down the Rails Hosts that I have heard of,
in India. <!--more-->

Here’s the list, not in any specific order:

1.  [SpeedHost](http://www.speedhost.in/ruby-on-rails-hosting.html) –
    SpeedHost.in provides ROR hosting on Linux servers with 2 affordable
    hosting plans.
2.  [Traffic Pullz](http://www.trafficpullz.com/web-hosting-ruby.html) –
    a very detailed list of services available with them (related to
    Rails) has been mentioned on their site.
3.  [WebServerIndia](http://www.webserverindia.com/) – provides linux
    and windows web hosting and also offer Reseller Web Hosting Services
    in India. They support Ruby on Rails Hosting, cPanel Hosting, PHP,
    MySQL, (Support available in English and Hindi).
4.  [Web Hosting Delhi](http://www.webhostingdelhi.com/) – I believe
    that they support Ruby on Rails Hosting but I could not find a
    mention about that on their site.
5.  [Web Hosting India](http://www.netwayweb.net/linux_reseller.php) –
    offer Rails hosting via their Linux Reseller Hosting Plan.

I agree, not many hosts but I am sure more would follow. I would
appreciate if you could comment here about your experiences with these
hosts and of any other host not mentioned here.

**Reference**:
[RailsWebHosts](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts#Asia)
– though most Rails hosts have been mentioned here, this url is not
easily ‘findable’.

  <p>
    I have been asked time and again about &#8216;<strong>Rails Hosting In India</strong>&#8216; and thought it best that I list down the Rails Hosts that I have heard of, in India.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s the list, not in any specific order:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.speedhost.in/ruby-on-rails-hosting.html">SpeedHost</a> &#8211; SpeedHost.in provides ROR hosting on Linux servers with 2 affordable hosting plans.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.trafficpullz.com/web-hosting-ruby.html">Traffic Pullz</a> &#8211; a very detailed list of services available with them (related to Rails) has been mentioned on their site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.webserverindia.com/">WebServerIndia</a> &#8211; provides linux and windows web hosting and also offer Reseller Web Hosting Services in India. They support Ruby on Rails Hosting, cPanel Hosting, PHP, MySQL, (Support available in English and Hindi).
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.webhostingdelhi.com/">Web Hosting Delhi</a> &#8211; I believe that they support Ruby on Rails Hosting but I could not find a mention about that on their site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.netwayweb.net/linux_reseller.php">Web Hosting India</a> &#8211; offer Rails hosting via their Linux Reseller Hosting Plan.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    I agree, not many hosts but I am sure more would follow. I would appreciate if you could comment here about your experiences with these hosts and of any other host not mentioned here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Reference</strong>: <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts#Asia">RailsWebHosts</a> &#8211; though most Rails hosts have been mentioned here, this url is not easily &#8216;findable&#8217;.

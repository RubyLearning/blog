The [RubyLearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/) site has been active
for some time now and the users of my site are normally people learning
the Ruby programming language.<!--more--> For the last two years, I have been
promoting the Ruby language in whatever way I can and have been keen
knowing whether Ruby is catching on in India or not. With the help of
[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), I sat down to
analyze the ‘**Ruby Usage Trend in Indian Cities**‘.

Statistical purists might laugh at my sampling data but I believe that
this data represents the trend fairly accurately. Amongst the 100’s of
Indian Cities in my analytics data, I selected the top 20% cities that
covered 80% of my site’s total hits during the period May to October
2007. The cities that qualified were Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai
and Hyderabad in that order.

**The Trend Chart**

**Some Results**

1.  Pune and Hyderabad had a slow start, but both cities have an
    increasing trend of usage. I am happy with the substantial increase
    in the usage of Ruby in Pune.
2.  Chennai and Bangalore seem to have started cooling off – why?
3.  I have the figures for November (so far) and Pune and Hyderabad
    continue to show a far rapid increase than previous months

Why is there such a rapid growth in Pune and Hyderabad? Have not heard
of any high-profile Ruby projects coming here. Lots of questions – no
clear answers.

What do you think? Do you have a different perspective on this? Do post
your viewpoint here.

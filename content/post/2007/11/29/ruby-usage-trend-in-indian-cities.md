    The <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">RubyLearning.com</a> site has been active for some time now and the users of my site are normally people learning the Ruby programming language. For the last two years, I have been promoting the Ruby language in whatever way I can and have been keen knowing whether Ruby is catching on in India or not. With the help of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, I sat down to analyze the &#8216;<strong>Ruby Usage Trend in Indian Cities</strong>&#8216;. 
    
    <p>
      Statistical purists might laugh at my sampling data but I believe that this data represents the trend fairly accurately. Amongst the 100&#8217;s of Indian Cities in my analytics data, I selected the top 20% cities that covered 80% of my site&#8217;s total hits during the period May to October 2007. The cities that qualified were Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai and Hyderabad in that order.

      <strong>Some Results</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pune and Hyderabad had a slow start, but both cities have an increasing trend of usage. I am happy with the substantial increase in the usage of Ruby in Pune.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chennai and Bangalore seem to have started cooling off &#8211; why?
      </li>
      <li>
        I have the figures for November (so far) and Pune and Hyderabad continue to show a far rapid increase than previous months
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Why is there such a rapid growth in Pune and Hyderabad? Have not heard of any high-profile Ruby projects coming here. Lots of questions &#8211; no clear answers.

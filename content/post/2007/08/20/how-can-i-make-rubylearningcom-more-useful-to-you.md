  <h4>
    It&#8217;s time for a reader question &#8211; how can I make my rubylearning.com site / blog / forum more useful for you?
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    I like to ask readers this question in an effort to keep improving the site / blog / forum and making it more effective in helping to improve your Ruby learning process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I donâ€™t like to lead such discussions too deliberately &#8211; but find that the discussion is better if I give a few general questions to stimulate the conversation. So here are some areas you might like to comment on:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Topics</strong> &#8211; are there topics (specific or general) youâ€™d like covered in the coming months? What are the main issues that youâ€™re facing as a would-be Ruby developer at the moment? What would you like to learn about or grow most in for the remainder of the year?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Types of Posts</strong> &#8211; reader questions, more mini-tutorials, case studies, short tips, guest posts, tool reviewsâ€¦. have your say about what youâ€™d like most/least.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Posting Frequency</strong> &#8211; too many posts, not enough, just right?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Community</strong> &#8211; do you feel you connect well with other readers? Are there features that youâ€™d like added to help connect more?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Other Ideas and Feedback</strong> &#8211; anything goes, big or little.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The â€˜Rulesâ€™</strong> &#8211; Any feedback, suggestions, dreams or ideas that you have are welcome. While I canâ€™t promise to respond to each comment or put every suggestion into place I <strong>make a commitment to you</strong> to read anything you have to say.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All that I ask in return is that you be <strong>honest, courteous</strong> and <strong>constructive</strong> with your feedback.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RubyLearning is a project that I pour a lot of time and effort into &#8211; as a result sometimes criticism can be a little difficult to hear &#8211; however I think itâ€™s vital to take it all on board if this is to continue to be a valuable resource for would-be Ruby developers wanting to improve their Ruby skills.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So itâ€™s over to you. Feel free to either leave your feedback here or to share them privately with me via my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/contact/contact.html">Contact Page</a> on rubylearning.com

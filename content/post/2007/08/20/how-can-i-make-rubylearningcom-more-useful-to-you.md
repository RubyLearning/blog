#### It’s time for a reader question – how can I make my rubylearning.com site / blog / forum more useful for you?

I like to ask readers this question in an effort to keep improving the
site / blog / forum and making it more effective in helping to improve
your Ruby learning process.

I don't like to lead such discussions too deliberately – but find that
the discussion is better if I give a few general questions to stimulate
the conversation. So here are some areas you might like to comment on:

**Topics** – are there topics (specific or general) youâ€™d like covered
in the coming months? What are the main issues that youâ€™re facing as a
would-be Ruby developer at the moment? What would you like to learn
about or grow most in for the remainder of the year?

**Types of Posts** – reader questions, more mini-tutorials, case
studies, short tips, guest posts, tool reviewsâ€¦. have your say about
what youâ€™d like most/least.

**Posting Frequency** – too many posts, not enough, just right?

**Community** – do you feel you connect well with other readers? Are
there features that youâ€™d like added to help connect more?

**Other Ideas and Feedback** – anything goes, big or little.

**The 'Rules'** – Any feedback, suggestions, dreams or ideas that
you have are welcome. While I can't promise to respond to each comment
or put every suggestion into place I **make a commitment to you** to
read anything you have to say.

All that I ask in return is that you be **honest, courteous** and
**constructive** with your feedback.

RubyLearning is a project that I pour a lot of time and effort into – as
a result sometimes criticism can be a little difficult to hear – however
I think it's vital to take it all on board if this is to continue to
be a valuable resource for would-be Ruby developers wanting to improve
their Ruby skills.

So it's over to you. Feel free to either leave your feedback here or
to share them privately with me via my [Contact
Page](http://rubylearning.com/contact/contact.html) on rubylearning.com

**[Deploying Rails
Applications](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_deploy/)** –
A Step-by-Step Guide by Ezra Zygmuntowicz (Engine Yard founder), [Bruce
Tate](http://blog.rapidred.com/) and Geoffrey Grosenbach is now a Beta
book.

If you buy the book Deploying Rails Applications you can get early
notification when it ships, order a beta copy, and support the publisher
and author that make it happen. Bruce Tate will be giving a percentage
of his cut to charity… probably Homes Without Borders. Please help them
make the best book possible.

A lot of you, the readers of my [Free Ruby Study
Notes](http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html), wrote in asking
for a simple program and a brief explanation on how to connect to a
MySQL database using Ruby and ActiveRecord. I just sat down and added
the page [Ruby ActiveRecord and
MySQL](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_activerecord_and_mysql.html)
to my [RubyLearning](http://rubylearning.com/) site. Have a look.

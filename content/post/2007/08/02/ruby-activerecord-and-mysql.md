  <p>
    A lot of you, the readers of my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html">Free Ruby Study Notes</a>, wrote in asking for a simple program and a brief explanation on how to connect to a MySQL database using Ruby and ActiveRecord. I just sat down and added the page <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_activerecord_and_mysql.html">Ruby ActiveRecord and MySQL</a> to my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">RubyLearning</a> site. Have a look.

In August 2006, I conducted some **Free Ruby Lessons** on the net. Peter
Cooper the author of [Beginning
Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/03/28/beginning-ruby/) wrote a
small note on his popular [Ruby
Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/free-ruby-lessons-from-satish-talim-210.html)
blog and over 100+ would-be Ruby developers registered and learned Ruby
along with me. These lessons culminated into my
[RubyLearning](http://rubylearning.com/) site and my [Ruby Study Notes
eBook](http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html).

Even today, I keep getting a lot of emails to re-start these lessons,
and to encourage you all, I have decided to do so.

Here’s the plan:

-   The Free Ruby Lessons are open to anyone who wants to get involved.
-   First, you need to register yourself on the [RubyLearning
    Forum](http://www.rubylearning.com/forum/index.php). **If you are
    already a member of the forum, you don’t need to register again.**
-   I shall be covering Core Ruby as outlined by this [Ruby
    syllabus](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html).
-   I start the Free Ruby Lessons from Monday, 27th August 2007 IST.
-   You can join the classes and start anytime you want.
-   Depending on my time availability, every third or fourth day I shall
    tell you to read, explore, try out the problems on the topics that I
    will outline to you on the
    **[forum](http://www.rubylearning.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29)**.
-   You should post your questions, queries related to those topics on
    the forum itself, where anyone is free to answer.
-   Finally, I will assume that you know some programming language and
    the focus of the lessons would be more towards application
    programming.

I have found that if one learns a programming language along with a
group and with set targets every day; one learns faster.

In case you have any queries or questions about this blog post, kindly
post them as comments here.

Also, please pass on this message to all those interested in learning
Ruby programming.

Come on, **[Join the Free Ruby

**Update:**

**5th Sept. at 8.00 hrs** – Over 365+ would-be Ruby developers are
under-going the course.

    In August 2006, I conducted some <strong>Free Ruby Lessons</strong> on the net. Peter Cooper the author of <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/03/28/beginning-ruby/">Beginning Ruby</a> wrote a small note on his popular <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/free-ruby-lessons-from-satish-talim-210.html">Ruby Inside</a> blog and over 100+ would-be Ruby developers registered and learned Ruby along with me. These lessons culminated into my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">RubyLearning</a> site and my <a href="http://rubylearning.com/download/downloads.html">Ruby Study Notes eBook</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even today, I keep getting a lot of emails to re-start these lessons, and to encourage you all, I have decided to do so.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s the plan:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Free Ruby Lessons are open to anyone who wants to get involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      First, you need to register yourself on the <a href="http://www.rubylearning.com/forum/index.php">RubyLearning Forum</a>. <strong><span style="color:red;">If you are already a member of the forum, you don&#8217;t need to register again.</span></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      I shall be covering Core Ruby as outlined by this <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html">Ruby syllabus</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I start the Free Ruby Lessons from Monday, 27th August 2007 IST.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can join the classes and start anytime you want.
    </li>
    <li>
      Depending on my time availability, every third or fourth day I shall tell you to read, explore, try out the problems on the topics that I will outline to you on the <strong><a href="http://www.rubylearning.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29">forum</a></strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should post your questions, queries related to those topics on the forum itself, where anyone is free to answer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, I will assume that you know some programming language and the focus of the lessons would be more towards application programming.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    I have found that if one learns a programming language along with a group and with set targets every day; one learns faster.
  </p>
  
  <p>

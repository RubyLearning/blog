  <p>
    <a href="http://www.petercooper.co.uk/">Peter Cooper</a> has done it again! Peter has just launched <a href="http://www.jrubyinside.com/">JRuby Inside</a> a new &#8220;sister&#8221; site to his very popular Ruby Inside. JRuby Inside focuses just on <strong>JRuby</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    About JRuby Inside, Peter says:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      JRuby Inside is not just a blog. It collates links from various sources, allows me (as the webmaster) to promote certain ones to posts or to the RSS feed, and even allows regular visitors to submit posts. It&#8217;s a more freeform but less demanding site than Ruby Inside, but hopefully will provide just as much value in a smaller niche.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Peter, the very best wishes from the Ruby and Java communities for the success of JRuby Inside.

[Peter Cooper](http://www.petercooper.co.uk/) has done it again! Peter
has just launched [JRuby Inside](http://www.jrubyinside.com/) a new
“sister” site to his very popular Ruby Inside. JRuby Inside focuses just
on **JRuby**.<!--more-->

About JRuby Inside, Peter says:

> JRuby Inside is not just a blog. It collates links from various
> sources, allows me (as the webmaster) to promote certain ones to posts
> or to the RSS feed, and even allows regular visitors to submit posts.
> It’s a more freeform but less demanding site than Ruby Inside, but
> hopefully will provide just as much value in a smaller niche.

Peter, the very best wishes from the Ruby and Java communities for the
success of JRuby Inside.

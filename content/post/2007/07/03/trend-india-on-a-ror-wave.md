  <p>
    With <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a></strong>, you can compare the world&#8217;s interest in your favorite topics. Google Trends shows how frequently your topics have appeared in Google News stories, and in which geographic regions people have searched for them most.

    Taking this further, I decided to see the <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails&ctab=0&geo=all&date=2007&sort=0">trend for Ruby on Rails for the year 2007</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Amongst <em>Regions</em>, India is ranked second. When I clicked on <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails&date=2007&geo=ind&ctab=0&ctab=0&sa=N">India</a>, I found that amongst <em>Subregions</em> Karnataka and Maharashtra are at the top &#8211; obviously due to Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune. However to my surprise the city Pune was not listed. Pune, incidentally has one of the largest Ruby User Groups in the world. Also surprising was that Belgaum was listed amongst cities. The data as of today is only for Jan and Feb 2007.

  <p>
    What is re-assuring is that Ruby on Rails is on the up-surge in India.

With **[Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends)**, you can compare
the world’s interest in your favorite topics. Google Trends shows how
frequently your topics have appeared in Google News stories, and in
which geographic regions people have searched for them most.

Taking this further, I decided to see the [trend for Ruby on Rails for
the year
2007](http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails&ctab=0&geo=all&date=2007&sort=0).

Amongst *Regions*, India is ranked second. When I clicked on
[India](http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails&date=2007&geo=ind&ctab=0&ctab=0&sa=N),
I found that amongst *Subregions* Karnataka and Maharashtra are at the
top – obviously due to Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune. However to my surprise
the city Pune was not listed. Pune, incidentally has one of the largest
Ruby User Groups in the world. Also surprising was that Belgaum was
listed amongst cities. The data as of today is only for Jan and Feb
2007.

What is re-assuring is that Ruby on Rails is on the up-surge in India.

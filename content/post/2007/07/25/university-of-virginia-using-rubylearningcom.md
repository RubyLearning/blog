Pete Yadlowsky at the [University of Virginia](http://virginia.edu/) is
teaching a short course in **Ruby** to some of his co-workers. The class
meets 2 hours once/week for six weeks. It presently meets on Tuesdays,
and so he calls it “[Ruby Tuesdays](http://spot.itc.virginia.edu/ruby/)”
(a humorous allusion to the famous Rolling Stones song and to a
restaurant chain). He was looking for good teaching materials and found
[rubylearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/), among others. Thanks Pete
and all the best for the “Ruby Tuesdays.”

**Update:**\
The University of Washington extension center is offering a [Ruby
Programming Certificate
Program](http://www.extension.washington.edu/ext/certificates/rby/rby_gen.asp).
The instructor for this programme would be [Ryan
Davis](http://zenspider.com/), founding member of the Seattle Ruby
Brigade.

From the programme:

> The Certificate is practical and hands-on. The first course provides
> an overview of the language and introduce many of the key concepts
> needed to begin programming quickly. The second course focuses on
> application development with “Rails.” Students will work on developing
> web sites and then iteratively develop projects to enhance those
> websites. The third course emphasizes the remaining advanced topics in
> the Ruby Programming language. All courses are project-focused and
> hands-on, allowing students the ability to engage in real-world
> applications and to interact with others in a group-work setting. The
> course will also focus on working within the open-source community and
> contributing to its overall development.

[Binghamton
University](http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/HW/hw1F07.html),
State University of New York is also using this site as one of their
references.

Good to see more and more Universities offering such courses.

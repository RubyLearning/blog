  <h2>
    Programming the Web with Ruby
  </h2>
  
  <p class="update">
    <span class="drop_cap">R</span>egistrations are now open for RubyLearning&#8217;s &#8220;<b>Pay if you like</b>&#8220;, online course on &#8220;<strong>Programming the Web with Ruby</strong>&#8220;. <b>The first batch had over 2000 participants</b>. Web-based applications offer many advantages, such as instant access, automatic upgrades, and opportunities for collaboration on a massive scale. However, creating Web applications requires different approaches than traditional applications and involves the integration of numerous technologies. The course topics would hopefully help those that <b>have some knowledge of Ruby programming</b> to get started with web programming (<em>this does not cover Ruby on Rails</em>).
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Who&#8217;s It For?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>Anyone with some knowledge of Ruby programming</b>.
  </p>

    Is the course really free?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A lot of effort and time goes into building such a course and we would really love that you pay at least <b>US$ 15</b> for the course. Since this is a &#8220;<b>Pay if you Like</b>&#8221; course, you are under no obligation to pay and hence the course would be free for you.

    Mentors
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://satishtalim.com/">Satish Talim</a> and Victor Goff III from the RubyLearning team.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Some Highlights
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    RubyLearning’s IRC Channel
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with the mentors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Google Hangouts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively here.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Git Repositories
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record your progress while learning Ruby.
  </p>

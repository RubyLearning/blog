In June 2009, we had compiled a [list of companies in Pune][1] that
execute projects / develop products using **Ruby and Ruby on
Rails**. A lot has changed since then; many companies are no longer
existing and some like **Josh Software** are growing! So, if you are
looking at outsourcing your work to companies in Pune India, this list
will be very helpful.

This time around, I am experimenting with [Listly][2] to list out the
companies. Here goes:

**[Ruby, Rails companies in Pune,

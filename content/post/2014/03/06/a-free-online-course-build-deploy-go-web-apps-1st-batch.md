  <h2>
    Build, Deploy Go Web Apps
  </h2>
  
  <p class="update">
    <span class="drop_cap">R</span>egistrations are now open for RubyLearning&#8217;s &#8220;<b>Pay if you like</b>&#8220;, online course on &#8220;<strong>Build, Deploy Go Web Apps</strong>&#8220;. Web-based applications offer many advantages, such as instant access, automatic upgrades, and opportunities for collaboration on a massive scale.

  <h4>
    RubyLearning’s IRC Channel
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning’s IRC (irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions on Ruby with the mentors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Google Hangouts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively here.

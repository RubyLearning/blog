The second annual [Shorty Awards](http://shortyawards.com/) nomination
process has begun! <!--more-->In January 2010, the community is invited to nominate
Twitter users for excellence over the past year. The awards recognize
each content creator’s entire body of work, not just an individual
tweet. [Nominations](http://shortyawards.com/rules) are made by sending
a tweet, whether it’s through this site or on Twitter.

In February 2010, the nominees will be narrowed down to five finalists
in each category. Winners will be determined by a combination of popular
vote and by the members of the new [Real-Time Academy of Short Form Arts
& Sciences](http://rtacademy.org/). An awards ceremony, complete with
140-character acceptance speeches, will be held in March 2010 in New
York City.

The Shorty Awards are a worldwide effort to engage hundreds of thousands
of Twitter users to identify the best people and organizations on
Twitter.

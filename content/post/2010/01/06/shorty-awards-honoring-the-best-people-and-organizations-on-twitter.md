    The second annual <a href="http://shortyawards.com/">Shorty Awards</a> nomination process has begun! In January 2010, the community is invited to nominate Twitter users for excellence over the past year. The awards recognize each content creator&#8217;s entire body of work, not just an individual tweet. <a href="http://shortyawards.com/rules">Nominations</a> are made by sending a tweet, whether it&#8217;s through this site or on Twitter.

Winners will be determined by a combination of popular vote and by the members of the new <a href="http://rtacademy.org/">Real-Time Academy of Short Form Arts & Sciences</a>. An awards ceremony, complete with 140-character acceptance speeches, will be held in March 2010 in New York City.

    The Shorty Awards are a worldwide effort to engage hundreds of thousands of Twitter users to identify the best people and organizations on Twitter.

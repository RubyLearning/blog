  <h2>
    Do You Enjoy Your Code Quality?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>James M. Schorr</strong> gives real-world tips on how to enjoy crafting software by improving the quality of your code and your development habits.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The goal of this article is to enable you to improve code quality and, thus, transform the mundane into the beautiful. No matter where you’re at on the spectrum, beginner to advanced, there is always room for improvement. As the code quality improves, your ability to delight in it and enjoy what you’re doing does as well.

  <h2>
    14 Ways To Have Fun Coding Ruby
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Jeff Schoolcraft</strong> shows you 14 different ways to have fun coding with Ruby.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      From time to time you might need to spice up your romance with code to make it a bit more interesting and fun. Maybe you’ve been there? You’d rather do anything except find the extra closing tag in some view. Or maybe you’ve stumbled across some particularly horrible use of google + copy and paste. Or, you might just be looking to practice. You don’t necessarily want to get on the same treadmill day after day so you’re looking for something new.

  <h2>
    The Ruby movement
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> writes about the &#8220;Ruby movement&#8221;, a parallel between art movements and programming and what makes Ruby special.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The programming world is much closer to the art world than you might think. Painters, sculptors, architects, singers, writers, cinematographers and photographers are recognized as artists, while programmers/coders/hackers are not there yet. One could argue that programming is more of a craft than an art, but instead of getting into semantics, let&#8217;s look at &#8220;programming movements&#8221; the same way we look at &#8220;art movements&#8221;.

  <h2>
    An introduction to eventmachine, and how to avoid callback spaghetti
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Martyn Loughran</strong> gives an introduction to eventmachine, and how to avoid callback spaghetti.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Evented programming has become cool lately, largely due to the very elegant node.js project. However, we’ve been evented in the Ruby world for many years thanks to eventmachine, which adds evented IO to Ruby. Writing evented code is often viewed as ‘hard’ or ‘back to front’, but it can actually be very elegant. You just need a few tricks up your sleeve.

  <h2>
    Do YOU know Ruby’s ‘Chainsaw’ method?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong> Paolo Perrotta</strong> loves Ruby&#8217;s &#8216;Chainsaw&#8217; method &#8211; method_missing(). Paolo shows you why.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The method_missing() method is a wonderful tool for every Ruby programmer. I love it. There, I said it! Some Rubyists are surprised when I declare my love for method_missing(). They do have a point. As far as tools go, method_missing() is a chainsaw: it’s powerful, but it’s also potentially dangerous.

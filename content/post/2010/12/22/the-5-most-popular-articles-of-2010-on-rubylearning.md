The year 2010 saw RubyLearning’s awesome guest authors write and share
their knowledge with others. If you missed any of these useful articles
then here’s the roundup of the **5 most popular articles of 2010 on
RubyLearning**. Enjoy!

Do You Enjoy Your Code Quality?
-------------------------------

**James M. Schorr** gives real-world tips on how to enjoy crafting
software by improving the quality of your code and your development
habits.

> The goal of this article is to enable you to improve code quality and,
> thus, transform the mundane into the beautiful. No matter where you’re
> at on the spectrum, beginner to advanced, there is always room for
> improvement. As the code quality improves, your ability to delight in
> it and enjoy what you’re doing does as well.

14 Ways To Have Fun Coding Ruby
-------------------------------

**Jeff Schoolcraft** shows you 14 different ways to have fun coding with
Ruby.

> From time to time you might need to spice up your romance with code to
> make it a bit more interesting and fun. Maybe you’ve been there? You’d
> rather do anything except find the extra closing tag in some view. Or
> maybe you’ve stumbled across some particularly horrible use of google
> + copy and paste. Or, you might just be looking to practice. You don’t
> necessarily want to get on the same treadmill day after day so you’re
> looking for something new.

The Ruby movement
-----------------

**Matt Aimonetti** writes about the “Ruby movement”, a parallel between
art movements and programming and what makes Ruby special.

> The programming world is much closer to the art world than you might
> think. Painters, sculptors, architects, singers, writers,
> cinematographers and photographers are recognized as artists, while
> programmers/coders/hackers are not there yet. One could argue that
> programming is more of a craft than an art, but instead of getting
> into semantics, let’s look at “programming movements” the same way we
> look at “art movements”.

An introduction to eventmachine, and how to avoid callback spaghetti
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Martyn Loughran** gives an introduction to eventmachine, and how to
avoid callback spaghetti.

> Evented programming has become cool lately, largely due to the very
> elegant node.js project. However, we’ve been evented in the Ruby world
> for many years thanks to eventmachine, which adds evented IO to Ruby.
> Writing evented code is often viewed as ‘hard’ or ‘back to front’, but
> it can actually be very elegant. You just need a few tricks up your
> sleeve.

Do YOU know Ruby’s ‘Chainsaw’ method?
-------------------------------------

**Paolo Perrotta** loves Ruby’s ‘Chainsaw’ method – method\_missing().
Paolo shows you why.

> The method\_missing() method is a wonderful tool for every Ruby
> programmer. I love it. There, I said it! Some Rubyists are surprised
> when I declare my love for method\_missing(). They do have a point. As
> far as tools go, method\_missing() is a chainsaw: it’s powerful, but
> it’s also potentially dangerous.

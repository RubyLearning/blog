Based on your opinion, we have designed a first-ever online **FREE**
introductory course “**Building a mobile app on an Android phone using
Rhodes**“<!--more-->

## Smartphones

A [smartphone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone) is a Personal
Pocket Computer with mobile phone functions, because these devices are
mainly computers, although smaller than a desktop computer. *Smartphones
is the fastest growing segment of the mobile phone market*.

Software development will [shift towards mobile
development](http://apress.com/book/view/1430228687) as the majority of
people who use computers will use them indirectly through a mobile
phone.

## Android

The [Android](http://www.android.com/) operating system is released
under the open source Apache License and is built on Linux kernel
version 2.6. Android is a project of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA).
Founded by Google, OHA is an association that includes 65
hardware/software companies and operators.

## Rhodes and Rhomobile

[Rhodes](http://rhomobile.com/products/rhodes/) is a cross-platform
smartphone application framework (Ruby based) developed by
[Rhomobile](http://rhomobile.com/). Rhodes is available for most major
smartphones including the iPhone, Research in Motion (BlackBerry),
Android, Windows Mobile, and Symbian. Rhodes allows developers to create
cross-platform smartphone applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
Ruby programming languages.

## Rhomobile – Our Sponsors

Rhomobile’s free and open source mobile application framework
[Rhodes](http://rhomobile.com/products/rhodes/) lets you quickly build
native mobile applications for all smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry,
Windows Mobile, Symbian and Android. These are true native device
applications (not mobile web apps) which work with synchronized local
data and take advantage of device capabilities such as GPS, PIM
contacts,camera, native mapping, push, alerts and calendar. Rhodes
invented the smartphone app framework (including that term) two years
ago and has had over 50,000 open source downloads since then. Rhodes is
the only smartphone framework with support for all smartphones, a Model
View Controller pattern, and, most importantly, support for synchronized
offline data. Because of these features, all critical for enterprise
needs, several large Fortune 500 companies have standardized on Rhodes
for mobile development.

## Who is the course for?

This course is for *newbies* with knowledge of:

## What will you learn?

-   This introductory course quickly gets you up to speed with writing
    an app for Android devices using Rhodes and RhoHub.

  <h3>
    Want To Build A Mobile App On An Android Phone With Rhodes?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">B</span>ased on your opinion, we have designed a first-ever online <b>FREE</b> introductory course &#8220;<strong>Building a mobile app on an Android phone using Rhodes</strong>&#8220;

  <h3>
    Smartphones
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">smartphone</a> is a Personal Pocket Computer with mobile phone functions, because these devices are mainly computers, although smaller than a desktop computer. <em>Smartphones is the fastest growing segment of the mobile phone market</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Software development will <a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1430228687">shift towards mobile development</a> as the majority of people who use computers will use them indirectly through a mobile phone.
  </p>
  
  <h3>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> operating system is released under the open source Apache License and is built on Linux kernel version 2.6. Android is a project of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA). Founded by Google, OHA is an association that includes 65 hardware/software companies and operators.

  <h3>
    Rhodes and Rhomobile
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://rhomobile.com/products/rhodes/">Rhodes</a> is a cross-platform smartphone application framework (Ruby based) developed by <a href="http://rhomobile.com/">Rhomobile</a>. Rhodes is available for most major smartphones including the iPhone, Research in Motion (BlackBerry), Android, Windows Mobile, and Symbian.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rhomobile’s free and open source mobile application framework <a href="http://rhomobile.com/products/rhodes/">Rhodes</a> lets you quickly build native mobile applications for all smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Symbian and Android. These are true native device applications (not mobile web apps) which work with synchronized local data and take advantage of device capabilities such as GPS, PIM contacts,camera, native mapping, push, alerts and calendar. Rhodes invented the smartphone app framework (including that term) two years ago and has had over 50,000 open source downloads since then. Rhodes is the only smartphone framework with support for all smartphones, a Model View Controller pattern, and, most importantly, support for synchronized offline data. Because of these features, all critical for enterprise needs, several large Fortune 500 companies have standardized on Rhodes for mobile development.

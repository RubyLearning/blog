This month, RubyLearning completes five wonderful years of teaching Ruby
programming and allied technologies. Time flies when you’re having fun!<!--more-->

## So how does one celebrate a Ruby birthday?

Ruby has given a lot to me. It’s helped me meet some great people, it’s
given me a more global perspective on life and provided my family with a
good income (to name just a few benefits).

But I want more….

I want others to benefit from my Ruby knowledge. Not just in the
information that it provides – but I would love our collective knowledge
of Ruby to become something that changes the lives of people who through
circumstances beyond their control are unable to live to their
potential.

The result of this is that instead of having a Ruby birthday that is all
about me and RubyLearning I want to have one that gives something back.

## How?

To spread the warmth this holiday season, I’d like to invite you to buy
any of RubyLearning’s [eBooks](http://rubylearning.com/blog/ebooks/)
**till 31st Dec. 2010**. When you buy the eBook(s), **100% of the sale
proceeds will be donated to [CRY
India](http://www.cry.org/apps/donation.aspx)** along with an equal
amount by RubyLearning.

## Why CRY?

![CRY India](http://www.cry.org/resources/images/banner1.gif)

Given CRY’s experience of almost three decades of working with and for
children, they have realised that if you care enough about the situation
of underprivileged Indian children, enough to want to change it, to do
something, YOU CAN.

Like all of us, [Rippan](http://www.cry.org/whoweare/originfounder.html)
(their late founder) got upset to see the disparities that exist between
children. He hated to see children begging and working as domestic help.
Unlike most of us, though, he did something about it. To enable a
lasting change, all it takes is to stand up for what is the right thing
to do.

At CRY, what binds them is the belief that “Change is possible. Because
I’ll make it possible.” It is this zeal that enables individuals,
organisations, corporate houses, and institutions, originating from
various parts of India and overseas, representing every ethnic,
linguistic, religious and ideological persuasion, to come together to
restore to children what is rightfully theirs – a childhood.

Each of you can get involved by contributing your time, talent, skills
and dedication to raise funds through events, sales of products and
donations. Your commitment forms the core of this indigenous Indian
movement that today involves over 150,000 individuals and organisations,
all who believe in the rights of children.

## Should you donate?

If you can’t afford to buy any of RubyLearning’s eBook(s) then there’s
no pressure to. You can support the project by spreading the news about
it.

I’m not sure how much we’ll raise but hopefully together we can
“**Enroll children into government school** and provide educational
support to help them **stay in school**.”

**Will YOU join me?**

**Update**: This project is now over. Thank you for the overwhelming
response. I have donated Rs. 10000-00 to CRY India on 2nd Jan. 2011.

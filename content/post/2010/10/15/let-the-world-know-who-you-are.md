### Let The World Know Who YOU Are!

I am connected with awesome people across the globe thanks to my
RubyLearning sites and social networking websites like Facebook,
LinkedIn and Twitter.

I would love to learn about what *you* do. Please take a moment to
introduce yourself and tell us more about *yourself*. Feel free to talk
about your job or business and promote yourself here.

*Let us know in the comments section of this post. Remember, if you want
a picture to show with your comment, go get a

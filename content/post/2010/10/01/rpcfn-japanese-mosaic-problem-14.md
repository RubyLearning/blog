    <img class="alignright" title="Joseph Wilk" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/josephwilk.jpeg" alt="Joseph Wilk" /> Joseph Wilk is a member of the core development team for Cucumber. He has been developing for the web for over 10 years in both big and small companies and as an entrepreneur. After stints working with Java and Python he finally found Ruby. He now spends his time in-between eating Cucumbers working at Songkick.com. Having more fun than is healthy working as a Software Gardener building web systems, working on open source projects and giving talks around the world about testing. He suffers from test obsession and has given up hope of any treatment.

    Joseph Wilk has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The Japanese Mosaic problem is a logic puzzle based on a grid with the cells potentially containing numbers ranging 0 to 9. The numbers reflect for a cell how many of its neighbours and itself are shaded in. The fun aspect of these problems is once solved you end up with some pretty ASCII art. You&#8217;re challenge is to write an algorithm to solve any mosaic puzzle. The challenge provides the opportunity to explore data structures to represent the problem space and looking at how we can navigate the structure in search of a solution. There are lots of opportunities to also think about the efficiency in searching for a solution. A Cucumber feature has already been written for you with lots of scenarios exploring through examples the rules of the Japanese Mosaic problem. If you are not familiar with Cucumber checkout <a href="http://cukes.info/">http://cukes.info/</a>. This Cucumber feature is both your specification and your executable tests. You&#8217;re mission is to get all the Scenarios passing. There are many ways to solve the problem and I look forward to seeing how people tackle these in the different languages. Good luck and safe Cuking.

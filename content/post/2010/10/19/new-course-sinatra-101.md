## New Course: Sinatra 101

RubyLearning announces the ninth batch of the online “**Sinatra 101**”
course starting from **27th Nov. 2010**.

> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services
<!--more-->
## What’s Sinatra?

Sinatra is a micro-framework for quickly creating *tiny
web-applications* and *small services* in Ruby. It is not a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) based framework.

Please read – [Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why it
Matters](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html).

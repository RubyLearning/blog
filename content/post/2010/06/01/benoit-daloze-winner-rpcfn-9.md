    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Welcome Benoit and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong> I would first like to thank RubyLearning for all they have done. I am a 19 year old student in first bachelor in computer sciences (at UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve). I am studying Java at courses, but I think I did more Ruby this year. Well, I just can not stop thinking &#8220;This would be so much better in Ruby&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How did you get involved with Ruby programming?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong> I have been looking on Ruby for some years now. I met Ruby the first time as a scripting language in a game software when I was 15, and since then always wanted to know more about it. It took me some time to learn it, because I did not find the good resources. I feel I am getting more and more involved everyday, as does my knowledge of Ruby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Metaprogramming</b>: This introduces a great way to program, and allows you to make it even shorter. It gives me the feeling that I really have a control on the objects, because you can so easily manipulate them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Flexibility</b>: Whenever you think you can mix some concepts together in Ruby, it just works, limitations are rare, and often out of imagination&#8217;s bounds. You are pretty much doing it the way you want, and Ruby lets you code that way.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Blocks</b>: Blocks is a entire way of expression, and the amount of complex methods made simple by this is awesome. Just think how you would do a #group_by, #each_slice or #partition in other languages. Most of the time it would be far more verbose and you would likely get a headache. Ruby has brought all the many useful things in the core, because it can be expressed in a simple method.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong> I&#8217;m participating since the fourth challenge, and I&#8217;m happy to participate in these interesting challenges. It is also a great way to discover other&#8217;s code, often very imaginative and original. And coding always makes you better in the language, so it is all for the best!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> You are based in Belgium. How is the Ruby and Rails scenario there?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong> People have now started noticing Rails, but this activity is mainly driven by some specific companies. Ruby is somehow not known, and sadly ignored in universities. ( But I&#8217;m trying to remedy that <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> )
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> What are your future plans?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Benoit>></strong> I am going to work on Rails this summer, to discover this part of Ruby I have not used much yet. I&#8217;m also doing some Ruby everyday, for my own use, just feeling happy to code with a beautiful language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><em>Thank you Benoit. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Benoit would be glad to answer.</em></span>

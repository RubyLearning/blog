In this brief interview, Satish Talim of RubyLearning talks to **[Benoit

Programming Challenge For
Newbies](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/04/29/rpcfn-interactive-fiction-9/).

**Satish\>\>** Welcome Benoit and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Benoit\>\>** I would first like to thank RubyLearning for all they
have done. I am a 19 year old student in first bachelor in computer
sciences (at UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve). I am studying Java at courses, but
I think I did more Ruby this year. Well, I just can not stop thinking
“This would be so much better in Ruby”.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Benoit\>\>** I have been looking on Ruby for some years now. I met
Ruby the first time as a scripting language in a game software when I
was 15, and since then always wanted to know more about it. It took me
some time to learn it, because I did not find the good resources. I feel
I am getting more and more involved everyday, as does my knowledge of
Ruby.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Benoit\>\>**

1.  **Metaprogramming**: This introduces a great way to program, and
    allows you to make it even shorter. It gives me the feeling that I
    really have a control on the objects, because you can so easily
    manipulate them.
2.  **Flexibility**: Whenever you think you can mix some concepts
    together in Ruby, it just works, limitations are rare, and often out
    of imagination’s bounds. You are pretty much doing it the way you
    want, and Ruby lets you code that way.
3.  **Blocks**: Blocks is a entire way of expression, and the amount of
    complex methods made simple by this is awesome. Just think how you
    would do a \#group\_by, \#each\_slice or \#partition in other
    languages. Most of the time it would be far more verbose and you
    would likely get a headache. Ruby has brought all the many useful
    things in the core, because it can be expressed in a simple method.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Benoit\>\>** I’m participating since the fourth challenge, and I’m
happy to participate in these interesting challenges. It is also a great
way to discover other’s code, often very imaginative and original. And
coding always makes you better in the language, so it is all for the
best!

**Satish\>\>** You are based in Belgium. How is the Ruby and Rails
scenario there?

**Benoit\>\>** People have now started noticing Rails, but this activity
is mainly driven by some specific companies. Ruby is somehow not known,
and sadly ignored in universities. ( But I’m trying to remedy that
![:)](http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
)

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Benoit\>\>** I am going to work on Rails this summer, to discover this
part of Ruby I have not used much yet. I’m also doing some Ruby
everyday, for my own use, just feeling happy to code with a beautiful
language.

*Thank you Benoit. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Benoit
would be glad to answer.*

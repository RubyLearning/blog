## Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies

### RPCFN: The Game of Life (\#11)

#### By Elise Huard

## About Elise Huard

![Elise
Huard](http://rubylearning.com/images/pic1-125.jpg "Elise Huard")**Elise
Huard** is based in Brussels, Belgium and is the owner of Jabberwocky, a
solutions company mostly focused on Rails. She has worked with a few
other technologies before falling in love with Rails and Ruby about 3
years ago and going freelance to work with Ruby full time. She
contributes to open source projects as much as she can, and has given
talks at a few Ruby and Rails conferences. She’s a jack of all trades,
loves reading, tinkering, food, travel, learning, and people out of the
ordinary.

Elise has this to say about the challenge:

> *This challenge consists in implementing the game of life. This is a
> problem that is simple to understand, but requires some thought to
> implement correctly. Tests will help you spot your own reasoning
> fallacies. And of course, every hacker has to have implemented the
> game of life at least once

## Our Awesome Sponsor

**Backup My App** is an automatic backup service for Ruby on Rails
applications. You simply install the plugin to your Rails application

sponsored this challenge and is proud to make this contribution to the
Ruby community.

    screencasts](http://peepcode.com/screencasts/ruby-on-rails) and a
    free 10 GB account for a year from [Backup My
    App](http://backupmyapp.com/).
-   From the remaining working Ruby solutions, three participants would
    be selected randomly and each one would be awarded any **one** of

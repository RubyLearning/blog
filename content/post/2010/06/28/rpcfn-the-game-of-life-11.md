    <img class="alignright" title="Elise Huard" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/pic1-125.jpg" alt="Elise Huard" /><b>Elise Huard</b> is based in Brussels, Belgium and is the owner of Jabberwocky, a solutions company mostly focused on Rails. She has worked with a few other technologies before falling in love with Rails and Ruby about 3 years ago and going freelance to work with Ruby full time. She contributes to open source projects as much as she can, and has given talks at a few Ruby and Rails conferences. She’s a jack of all trades, loves reading, tinkering, food, travel, learning, and people out of the ordinary.

    Elise has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>This challenge consists in implementing the game of life. This is a problem that is simple to understand, but requires some thought to implement correctly. Tests will help you spot your own reasoning fallacies. And of course, every hacker has to have implemented the game of life at least once <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></em>
    </p>

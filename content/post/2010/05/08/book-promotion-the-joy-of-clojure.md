## Book Promotion: The Joy of Clojure

RubyLearning is pleased to announce the promotion of the book “**[The
Joy of Clojure](http://www.manning.com/fogus/)**” by author Michael
Fogus and Chris Houser.<!--more--> The general idea of a **book promotion** is that
it gives the participants a chance to ask relevant questions, interact
with the author of the book and in the process possibly win a copy of
the book, all for free!

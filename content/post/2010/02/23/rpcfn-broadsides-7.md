## Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies

### RPCFN: Broadsides (\#7)

-- By James Edward Gray II

## About James Edward Gray II

![James Edward Gray
II](http://rubylearning.com/images/jamesgray.jpg "James Edward Gray II")James
Edward Gray II was called into the principal’s office in high school for
writing a black jack program on his calculator and beaming it to all the
math students almost 20 years ago. He’s been tinkering with little code
challenges ever since. After discovering Ruby, he formalized this
process by creating the [Ruby Quiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/). Though he
no longer runs those challenges, he’s glad to see that the spirit lives
on in projects like the RPCFN.

James has this to say about the challenge:

> *The only way to learn to program is to have about 5,000 arguments
> with a compiler, in my opinion. How you get your time in is up to you,
> but I would rather do it with fun little exercises like the RPCFN than
> under more stressful circumstances. Given that, I tend to favor the
> game problems as they distract me from the learning I am really trying
> to accomplish and allow me to have more fun.*

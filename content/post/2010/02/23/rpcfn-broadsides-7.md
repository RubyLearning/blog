    About James Edward Gray II
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="James Edward Gray II" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/jamesgray.jpg" alt="James Edward Gray II" />James Edward Gray II was called into the principal&#8217;s office in high school for writing a black jack program on his calculator and beaming it to all the math students almost 20 years ago. He&#8217;s been tinkering with little code challenges ever since. After discovering Ruby, he formalized this process by creating the <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a>. Though he no longer runs those challenges, he&#8217;s glad to see that the spirit lives on in projects like the RPCFN.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    James has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>The only way to learn to program is to have about 5,000 arguments with a compiler, in my opinion. How you get your time in is up to you, but I would rather do it with fun little exercises like the RPCFN than under more stressful circumstances. Given that, I tend to favor the game problems as they distract me from the learning I am really trying to accomplish and allow me to have more fun.</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

RubyLearning is honored to have [Paolo
Perrotta](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/),
author of the book [Metaprogramming
Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356476?ie=UTF8&tag=satishtalimsw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356476),
who would be answering some of the questions in the course forum.

After the huge success of the first two “**Ruby Metaprogramming**”
batches, RubyLearning now announces the third official batch from 6th
Mar. 2010.

### What’s Ruby Metaprogramming?

Paolo Perrotta has this to say:

> As a Ruby programmer, you already know how much fun it is. Now see how
> to unleash its power, digging under the surface and exploring the
> language’s most advanced features: a collection of techniques and
> tricks known as *metaprogramming*. Once the domain of expert Rubyists,
> metaprogramming is now accessible to programmers of all levels – from
> beginner to expert.

Paolo goes on to say the following in a [recent
interview](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/):

> I realized that metaprogramming sits at the very heart of the
> language, and when you understand *metaprogramming*, that’s the moment
> you start “thinking in Ruby”.

### Who’s It For?

Anyone who has some background in Core Ruby can make the most out of
this course.

The course starts on 6th March 2010 and runs for 2 weeks. You first need
to [register on the site](http://rubylearning.org/) and then [enroll

What Will I Learn?
------------------

The brief outline of this course is:

**First Week:**

-   Review the object model of Ruby itself:
    -   read-only variable self
    -   singleton class
    -   scope of variables
-   Learn a lot of methods:
    -   eval
    -   instance\_eval
    -   class\_eval (aka: module\_eval)
    -   class\_variable\_set
    -   class\_variable\_get
    -   class\_variables (Try it out: instance\_variables)
    -   instance\_variable\_set (Try it out: instance\_variable\_get)
    -   define\_method
    -   const\_set
    -   const\_get (Try it out: constants)
    -   Class.new (Try it out: Struct.new)
    -   binding (Try it out: lambda)
    -   send (Try it out: method)
    -   remove\_method
    -   undef\_method
    -   method\_missing
    -   include
    -   extend
    -   included
    -   extended
-   Do the following five exercises and discuss them in the forum.
    -   Exercise 1: Get the values from outside the class.
    -   Exercise 2: Add your code to display ‘I like metaprogramming!’
    -   Exercise 3: Show lots of ways to define singleton method.
    -   Exercise 4: Glance inside Ruby with binding method.
    -   Exercise 5: Define a class without class and def.

**Second Week:**

-   Practice with assignments on how to write a tiny app with Ruby
    Metaprogramming techniques. The assignments are being prepared.

### For Newbies

We will provide you with short study notes. You can learn the following
and discuss the same in the course forum.

-   Instance variables, Methods and Classes
-   Calling a method
-   Useful methods in Ruby Metaprogramming
-   Ruby Blocks and Bindings
-   Solved Problems (two examples)

### For Intermediate Participants

We willl open the discussion forum with some advanced topics like
“Compare Ruby Callable Objects” (Yugui’s blog posts) etc.

### Who is conducting this course?

The course is conducted by **Satoshi Asakawa** from Japan with 24×7 help
from the mentors at RubyLearning. Satoshi is a Japanese Ruby enthusiast.

### Early Bird Registration Discounts

-   For the first 20 registrations, Course Fee: US\$ 5 per participant.
-   For the next 20 registrations, Course Fee US\$ 7 per participant.

The course fee goes towards maintaining RubyLearning and helps provide
quality content to you.

So hurry, registrations have started.

By the end of the course, and to reiterate what Paolo Perrotta said, you
will understand metaprogramming and that’s the moment you will start
“thinking in Ruby”.

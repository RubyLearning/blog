  <h3>
    About Dr. Bruce Scharlau
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignright" title="Dr. Bruce Scharlau" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/self-head-final_thumb1.png" alt="Dr. Bruce Scharlau" /> In Dr. Bruce&#8217;s own words: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been using and teaching Ruby since trying out the cookbook example in the summer of 2006. As soon as I saw how much easier it all was with Ruby and Rails, I was hooked. I now try to do as much with Ruby as I can with my teaching and own work. It’s a joy to code with Ruby compared to using other languages, which don’t seem as intuitive by comparison. When I’m not busy working, then I try to spend time with the family, or get out sailing.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dr. Bruce has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The challenge is useful for newbies as a way to extend their skills in a useful manner. They will learn how they solved the problem, and also gain from seeing how others solved the problem too. We all start from different places when we solve problems, so the ‘obvious’ solution to you, might not occur to someone else who has a different experience of Ruby. This is why it’s good to share examples and code together when possible too.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>
    Prizes
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The participant with the best Ruby solution (if there is a tie between answers, then the one who posted first will be the winner) will be awarded any <b>one</b> of PeepCode&#8217;s <a href="http://peepcode.com/screencasts/ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails screencasts</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      From the remaining working Ruby solutions, three participants would be selected randomly and each one would be awarded any <b>one</b> of Pragmatic&#8217;s <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming'>The Ruby Object Model and Metaprogramming</a> screencasts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The four persons who win, can&#8217;t win again in the next immediate challenge but can still participate.

    The Ruby Challenge

  <h4>
    The Challenge
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    As a developer it helps to be able to understand a client’s perspective and to build suitable applications to help them in their field. This means knowing a bit about the world. We’ll help this background knowledge by doing looking at some economic data, and also testing our XML parsing skills.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The file <a href="http://rubylearning.com/data/cia-1996.zip">cia-1996.xml</a> is the data from the CIA World Factbook of 1996 in XML format. It has details about 260 countries across five continents. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover the following details buried within this file:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      What is the population of the country with the most people? Yes, we know it’s China, but just how many people lived there in 1996?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the five countries with the highest inflation rates, and what were those rates in 1996?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the six continents in the file and which countries belong to which continent? Can you also produce them in alphabetical order?
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Once you’ve worked out how to do part (2), then you can do anything with this file; all you need is a bit of time. Knowing how to do (2) you could then do (3) without too much effort.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can use any XML library. I used REXML as it’s already there if you have Ruby installed; so don’t need to worry about any gem installs. You may also want to look at how REXML uses XPath.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Submit your solution of your code, which includes a test file that answers the three questions.
  </p>

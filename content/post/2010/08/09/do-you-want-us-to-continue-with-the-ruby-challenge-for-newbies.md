  <h3>
    Do YOU want us to continue with the Ruby Challenge for Newbies?
  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    RubyLearning has been conducting the monthly Ruby Programming Challenge for Newbies for over a year now and so far 11 challenges have been completed. The 12th Challenge is in progress. All this was possible due to the extensive support we got from <a href="http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org/">Rubyists</a> across the world.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However today, probably due to lack of time or other commitments, not many experienced Rubyists are willing to set a Ruby challenge for the newbies? So, what do we do with the newer challenges? Do we dis-continue with the challenges? Do we change it from monthly to as an when? What are <em>your</em> suggestions?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Newbies, do you find the challenge interesting and useful &#8211; what are <em>your</em> thoughts?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the meantime, are you interested in setting a Ruby challenge for the newbies? If so, do email me at <b>satishtalim [at] gmail.com</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do post <em>your</em> thoughts and suggestions. I am hopeful that we would be able to continue with the challenges.

    <b>11th Aug.</b> Based on the feedback received, I have decided to continue with the Ruby Challenges. However, these challenges may not be monthly but as and when. It&#8217;s now up to the Ruby community to help me out with setting the challenges. Let&#8217;s do it!

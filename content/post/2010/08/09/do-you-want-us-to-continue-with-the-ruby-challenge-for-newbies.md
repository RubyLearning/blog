RubyLearning has been conducting the monthly Ruby Programming Challenge
for Newbies for over a year now and so far 11 challenges have been
completed. The 12th Challenge is in progress. All this was possible due
to the extensive support we got from
[Rubyists](http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org/) across the world.<!--more-->

However today, probably due to lack of time or other commitments, not
many experienced Rubyists are willing to set a Ruby challenge for the
newbies? So, what do we do with the newer challenges? Do we dis-continue
with the challenges? Do we change it from monthly to as an when? What
are *your* suggestions?

Newbies, do you find the challenge interesting and useful – what are
*your* thoughts?

In the meantime, are you interested in setting a Ruby challenge for the
newbies? If so, do email me at **satishtalim [at] gmail.com**.

Do post *your* thoughts and suggestions. I am hopeful that we would be
able to continue with the challenges.

![Update](http://rubylearning.com/images/update.jpg "Update")

**11th Aug.** Based on the feedback received, I have decided to continue
with the Ruby Challenges. However, these challenges may not be monthly
but as and when. It’s now up to the Ruby community to help me out with
setting the challenges. Let’s do it!

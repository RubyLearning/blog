Introducing an intensive, online course for *beginners* that helps you
get started with **Ruby** programming.

## What’s Ruby?

According to
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) – “Ruby is
a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and
easy to write.”

**Yukihiro Matsumoto**, the creator of Ruby, in **[an
interview](http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html)**
says -

> I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They
> don’t want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel
> natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and
> concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use
> Ruby.

## What Will I Learn?

In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the [essential features
of Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html) that you
will end up using every day.

Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding challenge in
the mix, appropriate for the level we are at. We have been known to give
out a prize or two for the ‘best’ solution.

## Who’s It For?

**An *absolute beginner* but with some experience in some other
programming language**.

Many of you wrote in asking for details on how the course works. Here
are some of the details:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Someone shall always be there to answer them. Just to set the
expectations correctly, there is no real-time ‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some extra
    notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class reading material
    at a convenient time of your choice – the dates mentioned are just
    for your guideline. While reading, please make a note of all your
    doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments about the
    lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post these on the
    forum **under the relevant lesson**. There could be some questions
    that relate to something that has not been mentioned or discussed by
    the mentors thus far; you could post the same too. Please remember
    that with every post, do mention the operating system of your
    computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that day’s session.
-   There could be exercises every day. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas among
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. Please be aware that these messages are considered noises
    by people subscribed to the forum.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  Most of the days, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help you assimilate whatever you have learned till then.
2.  Some days may have some extra assignments / food for thought
    articles / programs
3.  **Above all, do take part in the relevant forums. Past participants
    will confirm that they learned the best by active participation.**

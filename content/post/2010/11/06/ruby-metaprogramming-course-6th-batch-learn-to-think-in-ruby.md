After the huge success of the first five “**Ruby Metaprogramming**”
batches, RubyLearning now announces the sixth batch from **4th Dec.
2010**.<!--more-->

## What’s Ruby Metaprogramming?

Paolo Perrotta has this to say:

> As a Ruby programmer, you already know how much fun it is. Now see how
> to unleash its power, digging under the surface and exploring the
> language’s most advanced features: a collection of techniques and
> tricks known as *metaprogramming*. Once the domain of expert Rubyists,
> metaprogramming is now accessible to programmers of all levels – from
> beginner to expert.

Paolo goes on to say the following in a [recent
interview](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/07/01/interview-author-paolo-perrotta/):

> I realized that metaprogramming sits at the very heart of the
> language, and when you understand *metaprogramming*, that’s the moment
> you start “thinking in Ruby”.

What Will I Learn?
------------------

The brief outline of this course is:

**First Week:**

-   Review the object model of Ruby itself:
    -   read-only variable self
    -   singleton class
    -   scope of variables
-   Learn a lot of methods:
    -   eval
    -   instance\_eval
    -   class\_eval (aka: module\_eval)
    -   class\_variable\_set
    -   class\_variable\_get
    -   class\_variables (Try it out: instance\_variables)
    -   instance\_variable\_set (Try it out: instance\_variable\_get)
    -   define\_method
    -   const\_set
    -   const\_get (Try it out: constants)
    -   Class.new (Try it out: Struct.new)
    -   binding (Try it out: lambda)
    -   send (Try it out: method)
    -   remove\_method
    -   undef\_method
    -   method\_missing
    -   include
    -   extend
    -   included
    -   extended
-   Do the following five exercises and discuss them in the forum.
    -   Exercise 1: Get the values from outside the class.
    -   Exercise 2: Add your code to display ‘I like metaprogramming!’
    -   Exercise 3: Show lots of ways to define singleton method.
    -   Exercise 4: Glance inside Ruby with binding method.
    -   Exercise 5: Define a class without class and def.

**Second Week:**

-   Practice with assignments on how to write a tiny app with Ruby
    Metaprogramming techniques. The assignments are being prepared.

## For Newbies

We will give you short study notes. You can learn the following and
discuss the same in the course forum.

-   Instance variables, Methods and Classes
-   Calling a method
-   Useful methods in Ruby Metaprogramming
-   Ruby Blocks and Bindings
-   Solved Problems (two examples)

## For Intermediate Participants

We willl open the discussion forum with some advanced topics like
“Compare Ruby Callable Objects” (Yugui’s blog posts) etc.

## Who is conducting this course?

The course teacher is **Satoshi Asakawa** from Japan with 24×7 help from
the mentors at RubyLearning. Satoshi is a Japanese Ruby enthusiast.

So hurry, registrations have started.

By the end of the course, and to reiterate what Paolo Perrotta said, you
will understand metaprogramming and that’s the moment you will start
“thinking in Ruby”.

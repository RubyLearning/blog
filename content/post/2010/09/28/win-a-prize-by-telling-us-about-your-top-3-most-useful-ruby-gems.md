Today I'd like to try something a little different on the blog and open
up a topic for some discussion. This one could cause some ‘energetic’
conversation but I’d love to do an informal poll on it anyway.<!--more-->

**Top 3 Most Useful Ruby Gems – and why?**

I’d love to hear your opinion and some of the reasoning for your choice.

There’s no right or wrong ultimately (although I know some readers hold
strong opinions on the matter) – but hopefully in the discussion and
reasons for your answer we’ll have some good learning.

Post your comments and go into the draw to win \$25 worth of screencasts
(Episode 1 to 5) from [The Pragmatic
Bookshelf](http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming).

**PS**: I’ll kick things off – I asked some Rubyists on their choice of
the “**Top 3 Most Useful Gems**” and here is what they said:

-   **[Bruce
    Tate](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/11/25/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-bruce-tate/)**
    –
    -   **[Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/)**: The nosql movement is in
        full swing, and mongoid is our mapper of choice. The criteria
        API is excellent, start-up is easy and efficient, and you can
        peel away the API to get straight to the MongoDB API beneath.
    -   **[Shoulda](http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda)**: I know this
        gem is going to be taking a back seat to rspec, but we love it.
        The matchers are brilliant, but I really love the lack of
        ceremony in this gem set. We maintain full testing coverage, and
        shoulda makes it easy.
    -   **[Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org/)**: I need to tip my hat to
        the team. They’ve done a great job simplifying routing, active
        record, and opening up the architecture at the same time.
-   **[Christopher Haupt](http://twitter.com/chaupt)** –
    -   **[nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)**: We do a lot of HTML and
        XML parsing/digesting for our app. Having tried many other tools
        for the job over time, I keep finding nokogiri gets the job done
        with simplicity, speed, and stability.
    -   **[haml](http://haml-lang.com/)**: It is actually painful for me
        to use ERB now that all of my projects use haml. The number of
        programming mistakes due to typos is much lower. Amazing what a
        little forced indentation can do.
    -   **[redcar](http://redcareditor.com/)**: This may be cheating a
        bit, but it is delivered as a gem! I constantly get asked about
        tools for Ruby development, and choice of editor can be
        something of a religious choice. I use TextMate, vim,
        e-TextEditor, and occasionally RubyMine. Redcar holds a lot of
        promise, is very hackable, and is open source!
-   **[Lucas Carlson](http://rufy.com/)** –
    -   **[andand](http://andand.rubyforge.org/)**: Nil error bugs are
        among the most common kind you encounter with imperative
        languages and the `andand` library bridges the gap in and easy
        and straightforward way. Not as good as functional programming,
        but a good compromise.
    -   **[aasm](http://rubygems.org/gems/aasm)**: State machines are a
        great way to deal with highly state-full interactions. Keeping
        track of whether an email account has been validated or if a
        blog post is published or drafted are great examples of ways
        that state machines can make your life easier.
    -   **[paperclip](http://thoughtbot.com/community/)**: Such an
        elegant solution to storing uploaded files with various backend
        data storage methods, this gem is one of the true gems of using
        Ruby.
-   **[Paul Barry](http://paulbarry.com/)** –
    -   **[Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)**: It has picked up the torch
        from Hpricot as the best way to parse HTML/XML. Nokogiri makes
        pulling data off the web so easy that powerful, useful programs
        can be written in just a few lines of code.
    -   **[Resque](http://github.com/defunkt/resque)**: Having a queue
        that can be used to process background jobs is essential for any
        web application. Resque uses
        [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis) to make that easy and
        provides a useful web interface to check in on your background
        jobs and see what’s going on.
    -   **[Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)**: Cucumber has completely
        changed the way I test applications by providing a way to write
        clear high-level tests that everyone involved in the project can
        understand. Having re-usable step definitions makes it fast and
        easy to write maintainable tests that only need to change when
        the business logic changes.
-   **[Sandip Ransing](http://www.funonrails.com/)** –
    -   **[Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org/)**: ROR is an open-source
        web framework which follows the MVC pattern and agile
        methodologies built over Ruby language. I am working with Rails
        for the past 3 years and have built many Rails applications in a
        very short period. Many thanks to David (creator of Rails) and
        the Rails team for their awesome work. The open-source community
        is playing a fantastic role in adding new features to Rails and
        by contributing through gems and plugins. Recently Rails 3 has
        released many more features. Let’s ride Rails 3 and definitely
        it would me more fun
        ![:)](http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    -   **[Thinking Sphinx](http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/)**:
        (Lines copied as it is from the sphinx site) Sphinx is a very
        fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways
        of searching it. Thinking Sphinx allows you to link up your
        models into Sphinx simply and painlessly -– because let’s face
        it, searching across multiple fields using SQL is a pain in the
        neck. There are other search options which we have used earlier
        before migrating to sphinx, such as **acts\_as\_ferret** (Lack
        of proper documentation and takes time to index, therefore
        performance wise not effective) and **acts\_as\_solr** (requires
        Java as an overhead. Good to use with JRuby, though). Sphinx
        (high performance, tons of records can be indexed within
        minutes, easy to use because of proper documentation).
    -   **[Prawn](http://github.com/sandal/prawn)**: PDF Library built
        over Ruby language to simplify pdf generation. Easy to use,
        neat, proper documentation, predefined layouts, faster,
        continuous development and support makes prawn the best among
        other pdf libraries.
-   **[Sébastien Grosjean](https://twitter.com/sebgrosjean)** –
    -   **[devise](http://rubygems.org/gems/devise)**: An highly
        flexible Authentication management. Baked with full features as
        an engine, it’s really quick to get started with default views,
        … but also really easy to update to your desired need and style.
    -   **[will\_paginate](http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wiki)**:
        Does an introduction is still needed? Simply the best solution
        I’ve found to handle any model pagination.
    -   **[routing\_filter](http://github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter)**:
        Working mainly in Europe, I have extensive needs to develop
        multilingual applications. On my side, routing\_filter helps me
        handle locales in URL and URL helpers. It gives a great
        flexibility, and allow you much more than that, can be really
        helpful for clean paginated URLs, showing extensions.
-   **[Sethupathi Asokan](http://joshsoftware.com/)** –
    -   **[Josh-splat](http://josh-splat.heroku.com/#1)**: Ruby gem is
        initiated and developed by Josh Software for SMS platform. It
        acts as a platform for different SMS service providers so that
        the user/developers don’t need to worry about different type of
        formats. In the recently concluded LSRC 2010 our [Gautam
        Rege](http://twitter.com/gautamrege) presented and got a
        wonderful response.
    -   **[Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org/)**: Josh Software is
        exclusive into RoR development and Rails 3 is a breeze for any
        web base application. It is evolving and widely accepted by
        everyone. There are growing number of hosting companies
        supporting Rails 3.
    -   **[delayed\_job](http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)**:
        One of the best worker thread we have worked on. It eases the
        developer’s work by providing various useful options (main one
        is retry).
-   **[Victor H. Goff III](http://vgoff.posterous.com/)** –
    -   **[RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)**: for allowing me to
        test various versions of Ruby, and for the gemsets that let you
        keep your development and application environment clean. For
        BSD/Linux based systems.
    -   **[bundler](http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler)**: for allowing
        you to ‘package’ your dependencies easily.
    -   **[pik](http://rubygems.org/gems/pik)**: for multiple Ruby
        versions for Windows users.

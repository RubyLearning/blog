## Programming Challenge for Newbies in Clojure and Python too?

RubyLearning has been conducting the monthly Ruby Programming Challenge
for Newbies for over a year now and so far 12 challenges have been
completed. The 13th challenge is in progress. All this was possible due
to the extensive support we got from
[Rubyists](http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org/) across the world.
Also, you all indicated that [we continue with these
challenges](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/08/09/do-you-want-us-to-continue-with-the-ruby-challenge-for-newbies/)
in the months to come.

Recently, my colleague [Dhananjay Nene](http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/)
posted a [Python based
solution](http://codeblog.dhananjaynene.com/2010/09/code-kata-ruby-programming-challenge-for-newbies-in-python/)
to the 13th Ruby challenge. While discussing the solution it struck me
that it would help Clojure and Python Newbies, if we opened up these
challenges in these languages too. Dhananjay and some of my Clojure
colleagues are interested in evaluating the submitted solutions in
Clojure and Python and maybe we could start the challenges from Oct.
2010.

Clojure and Python enthusiasts – interested? What Do you Think? What is
Your Opinion? Please share in the comments below.

![Update](http://rubylearning.com/images/update.jpg "Update")

**3rd Sept.** Thanks for the very encouraging response. Based on the
feedback received so far, we have decided the following:

-   We will start the challenges for Clojure, Python and Ruby from **1st
    Oct. 2010**. We will call these “**Programming Challenge for
    Newbies**” and host it on this blog till end Dec. 2010. If the
    response is encouraging, we can host the challenges on different
    domains.
-   We will have separate panels to evaluate the solutions. One each for
    Clojure, Python and Ruby.
-   We will keep separate prizes for the 3 languages (and hopefully
    would find some sponsors).
-   The challenge problem setters (fixed till Dec. 2010) would be told
    that the problem should be solvable in all languages and
    specifically Clojure, Python and Ruby. This means that the problem
    setter should not set a problem that needs to be solved by some
    specific language feature.

  <h3>
    About RubyLearning
  </h3>
  
  <p class="update">
    <abbr title="RubyLearning">RL</abbr> offers online courses in Ruby programming, Git & GitHub, Shoes, JRuby and Sinatra. Since 2005, over 25,000 participants spread across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and other Ruby related timely topics. This has been possible due to the extensive support provided by the mentors of these courses. RL strives hard to improve the methodology and course content based on the extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks to <strong>YOU</strong> and people like Fabio Akita who make this possible. <a href="http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html">Our Alumni</a> are our best ambassadors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span class="drop_cap">Y</span>ou kept asking for it and so here it is &#8211; the second batch of the intensive, online course that helps you get started with <strong>Clojure</strong> programming.

  <h3>
    What&#8217;s Clojure?
  </h3>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Wikipedia</a>: &#8220;Clojure is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a general-purpose language supporting interactive development that encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies multithreaded programming. Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine and the Common Language Runtime. Clojure honors the code-as-data philosophy and has a sophisticated Lisp macro system.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Stuart Halloway</b> in his <b><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a></b> book says &#8211; &#8220;Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back from the near future. Its support for functional programming and software trans-actional memory is well beyond current practice and is well suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history of programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries, and tooling of the dominant platform available today.&#8221;

Michael fell in love with Clojure on first sight sometime in early 2009, but unfortunately never seems to have as much time to work with it as he wants to and started being a mentor for <a href="http://www.rubylearning.org/class/">RubyLearning.org</a> in early 2009. His interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign languages, chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn&#8217;t need to sleep.

RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Git & GitHub, Shoes, JRuby
and Sinatra. Since 2005, over 25,000 participants spread across 140+
countries have learned Ruby<!--more--> and other Ruby related timely topics. This
has been possible due to the extensive support provided by the mentors
of these courses. RL strives hard to improve the methodology and course
content based on the extensive and critical feedback we receive. Thanks
to **YOU** and people like Fabio Akita who make this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

You kept asking for it and so here it is – the second batch of the
intensive, online course that helps you get started with **Clojure**
programming.

## What’s Clojure?

![Clojure](http://clojure.org/file/view/clojure-icon.gif "Clojure")

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure): “Clojure
is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a
general-purpose language supporting interactive development that
encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies multithreaded
programming. Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine and the Common
Language Runtime. Clojure honors the code-as-data philosophy and has a
sophisticated Lisp macro system.”

**Stuart Halloway** in his **[Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure)**
book says – “Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back
from the near future. Its support for functional programming and
software trans-actional memory is well beyond current practice and is
well suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well
grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the
Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history of
programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries, and
tooling of the dominant platform available today.”

## What Will I Learn?

[blog](http://citizen428.net/)) in his day job, works as a Ruby on Rails
programmer for [Tupalo.com](http://tupalo.com/) in Vienna, Austria.
Michael fell in love with Clojure on first sight sometime in early 2009,
but unfortunately never seems to have as much time to work with it as he
wants to and started being a mentor for
[RubyLearning.org](http://www.rubylearning.org/class/) in early 2009.
His interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign
languages, chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn’t need
to sleep.

### Daniel Solano Gómez

Daniel Solano Gómez ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/deepbluelambda) /
[blog](http://www.deepbluelambda.org/)) is the founder of Sattvik
Software & Technology Resources, a software development company based in
Houston, Texas. He studied mathematics at the University of Texas at
Austin, but he discovered his passion for programming and computers as a
child. Daniel has been developing software professionally for over a
decade, primarily with C++ and Java. He started learning about and
developing with Clojure in late 2009.

### Michał Marczyk

Michał Marczyk is a PhD student doing research in logic / universal
algebra in Kraków, Poland, always trying to coerce the computer into
proving his theorems for him. His programming background is
predominantly in functional programming; mostly in Scheme, Haskell and
Clojure, which is rapidly becoming his favourite language.

### Anthony Simpson

Anthony Simpson ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/IORayne) /
[Blog](http://blog.acidrayne.net)) is a young, ambitious programmer in
Eldridge, Alabama. His first language having been Haskell, the majority
of his time with programming has been with functional programming
languages, most of which has been spent with Clojure. A language person,
he enjoys learning about new languages and improvements they make on
existing languages. Non-computer-related interests include,
(roller)skating, all aspects of music, and hacking life.

### Isaac Hodes

![Update](http://rubylearning.com/images/update.jpg "Update")

Many of you wrote in asking for details on how the course works. Here
are some details:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Someone shall always be there to answer them. Just to set the
expectations correctly, there is no real-time ‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some
    additional notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class
    reading material at a convenient time of your choice – the dates may
    be specified only as a guideline. While reading, please make a note
    of all your doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments
    about the lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post
    these on the forum **under the relevant lesson**. There may be some
    questions that relate to something that has not been mentioned or
    discussed by the mentors thus far; you could post the same too.
    Please remember that with every post, do mention the operating
    system of your computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that week’s session.
-   There could be exercises for that week. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas amongst
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. This forum is subscribed by several hundred people, so
    please be aware that these messages are considered as noises by many
    people.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  The course starts on a Monday and the new course material will be
    available every Monday.
2.  Most of the weeks, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help you assimilate whatever you have learned till then.
3.  Some weeks may have some mid-week additional assignments / food for
    thought articles / programs
4.  **Above all, do participate in the relevant forums. Past
    participants will confirm that they learned the best by active
    participation.**

### Some Commonly Asked Questions

-   **Qs.** Is there any specific time when I need to be online?\
    **Ans.** No. You need not be online at a specific time of the day.
-   **Qs.** Is it important for me to participate in the course forums?\
    **Ans.** YES. You must Participate in the forum(s) for asking and
    answering questions or starting discussions. Share knowledge, and
    exchange ideas amongst yourselves (participants) during the course
    period. Participants are strongly encouraged to post technical
    questions, interesting articles, tools, sample programs or anything
    that is relevant to the class / lesson. Past participants will
    confirm that they learned the best by active participation.
-   **Qs.** How much time do I need to spend online for a course, in a
    day?\
    **Ans.** This will vary from person to person. All depends upon your
    comfort level and the amount of time you want to spend on a
    particular lesson or task.
-   **Qs.** Is there any specific set time for feedback (e.g., any
    mentor responds to me within 24 hours?)\
    **Ans.** Normally somebody should answer your query / question
    within 24 – 48 hours.
-   **Qs.** What happens if nobody answers my questions / queries?\
    **Ans.** Normally, that will not happen. In case you feel that your
    question / query is not answered, then please post the same in the
    thread – “Any UnAnswered Questions / Queries”.
-   **Qs.** What happens to the class (or forums) after a course is
    over? Can you keep it open for a few more days so that students can
    complete and discuss too?\
    **Ans.** The course and its forum is open for a month after the last
    day of the course.

Remember, the idea is to have fun learning Clojure.

creating apps to better help companies integrate branded interactive
campaigns with viral features of the social web. Karmen has over 10
years of experience in software development<!--more--> (Ruby since 2006) and 7
years of teaching web and software development at the college level.

![Karmen

remember sitting in CS 225, my first college programming class. The
teacher gave out the final project which was to create a hangman game.
It had to use ASCII characters to draw the lynched person and letters
while the person was playing the game. ASCII art at its finest! It was a
straightforward console application when at the time the Internet and
Web were not mainstream. That eventually changed.

I was fortunate enough to teach at a community college for seven years.
I taught various web and software development courses
([http://cis.scc.spokane.edu/?cissoftdev](http://cis.scc.spokane.edu/?cissoftdev)).
I was given lots of educational freedom to change curricula and refresh
it often. A major alteration was updating the core programming language
from Java to Ruby. Not only did it motivate me to teach it but I saw
students’ motivation factor raise a lot! It let the student focus more
on problem solving, code structure, and efficient algorithms rather than
fighting through the syntax of Java.

I use web apps everyday. Most apps I use are API based, for example
Twitter. The programming I do is web-based. So it makes sense to try to
mix the rigor of problem solving based console apps found in most
university introductory programming courses with cool Web apis. When I
taught I gave out lots of Ruby lectures and homework assignments, see:
[http://github.com/kblake/learning-ruby](http://github.com/kblake/learning-ruby)
and
[http://blog.dudeblake.com/search/label/ruby](http://blog.dudeblake.com/search/label/ruby).
I was thinking it would be cool to add a spark of web api development to
assignments to give them a fun twist.

For example, this class exercise which builds a histogram from random
data:

Using the twitter api you can easily grab information and format in
histogram form like this:

Another example is creating a menu driven system such as this:

Similarly, using the Pivotal Tracker API you can create a menu system to
interact with it:

The opportunities are endless and vast. Other fun Apis to use are
Flickr, Facebook’s OpenGraph, Github and more! Programming exercises
should not have to be limited to the desktop because we live in an
Internet world. Subsequent courses could then let students build
graphical or web clients.

Programming education in general is improving dramatically. I recommend
lessons and techniques from
[http://rubylearning.com/](http://rubylearning.com/),
[http://testfirst.org](http://testfirst.org/) and
[http://rubykoans](http://rubykoans.com/) as a few great resources for
teaching Ruby to new developers.

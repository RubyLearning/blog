## About RubyLearning

RL offers online courses in Ruby programming, Git & GitHub, FXRuby,
Shoes, JRuby and Sinatra. Since 2005, over 20,000 participants spread
across 140+ countries have learned Ruby and other<!--more--> Ruby related timely
topics. This has been possible due to the extensive support provided by
the mentors of these courses. RL strives hard to improve the methodology
and course content based on the extensive and critical feedback we
receive. Thanks to **YOU**, people like Fabio Akita and companies like
Locaweb who make this possible. [Our
Alumni](http://rubylearning.com/other/testimonials.html) are our best
ambassadors.

You kept asking for it and so here it is – the new introductory, free,
intensive, online course that helps you get started with **Clojure**
programming.

## Sponsor

[![Runa
Inc.](http://rubylearning.com/images/runa-forwebsites.jpg "Runa Inc.")](http://runa.com/)

Runa aims to provide small-to-not-so-large online retailers with
tools/services that companies like amazon.com use/provide. These smaller
guys can’t afford to do anything on that scale, but by using their SaaS
services, they can make more money while providing customers with
greater value.

## What’s Clojure?

![Clojure](http://clojure.org/file/view/clojure-icon.gif "Clojure")

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure): “Clojure
is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a
general-purpose language supporting interactive development that
encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies multithreaded
programming. Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine and the Common
Language Runtime. Clojure honors the code-as-data philosophy and has a
sophisticated Lisp macro system.”

**Stuart Halloway** in his **[Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure)**
book says – “Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back
from the near future. Its support for functional programming and
software trans-actional memory is well beyond current practice and is
well suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well
grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the
Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history of
programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries, and
tooling of the dominant platform available today.”

## What Will I Learn?

sight sometime in early 2009, but unfortunately never seems to have as
much time to work with it as he wants to and started being a mentor for
[RubyLearning.org](http://www.rubylearning.org/class/) in early 2009.
His interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign
languages, chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn’t need
to sleep.

![Update](http://rubylearning.com/images/update.jpg "Update")

Many of you wrote in asking for details on how the course works. Here
are some details:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Someone shall always be there to answer them. Just to set the
expectations correctly, there is no real-time ‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some
    additional notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class
    reading material at a convenient time of your choice – the dates may
    be specified only as a guideline. While reading, please make a note
    of all your doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments
    about the lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post
    these on the forum **under the relevant lesson**. There may be some
    questions that relate to something that has not been mentioned or
    discussed by the mentors thus far; you could post the same too.
    Please remember that with every post, do mention the operating
    system of your computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that week’s session.
-   There could be exercises for that week. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas amongst
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. This forum is subscribed by several hundred people, so
    please be aware that these messages are considered as noises by many
    people.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  The course starts on a Saturday and the new course material will be
    available every Saturday.
2.  Most of the weeks, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help you assimilate whatever you have learned till then.
3.  Some weeks may have some mid-week additional assignments / food for
    thought articles / programs
4.  **Above all, do participate in the relevant forums. Past
    participants will confirm that they learned the best by active
    participation.**

### Some Commonly Asked Questions

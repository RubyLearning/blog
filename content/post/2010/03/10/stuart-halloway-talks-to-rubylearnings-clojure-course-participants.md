    On the eve of the first free, online &#8220;<strong>Clojure 101</strong>&#8221; course, Michael Kohl of RubyLearning caught up with <strong>Stuart Halloway</strong>, author of <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a> and talked to him on <strong>Clojure</strong>, for the benefit of the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/03/09/clojure-101-a-new-course/">Clojure 101 course</a> participants.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> Welcome, Stuart and thanks for taking out time for RubyLearning&#8217;s Clojure course participants. For their benefit, could you tell us something about yourself?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> Along with Justin Gehtland, I co-founded <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/">Relevance</a>, a development shop that takes pride in staying near the cutting edge. We were early adopters of Ruby (and Rails), are are now early adopters of Clojure.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> How and when did you get involved with Clojure?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> I have been interested in Lisps for years, as a result of living in Emacs and reading Paul Graham and Steve Yegge. I discovered Clojure in early 2008, and quickly realized that it was the Lisp I had been looking for.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> You were closely involved with the Ruby language, what made you switch to Clojure?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> I still use Ruby, but it is fair to say that Clojure is currently my favorite general-purpose language. In short: I came for the Lisp, and I stayed for the fp and concurrency features.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> Many of RubyLearning&#8217;s Clojure course participants have a Java and or Ruby background. Why, in your opinion, should they learn Clojure?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> Used well, Clojure will be as fast as Java, as expressive as Ruby, and more thread-safe and multicore-ready than either. It is also one of those languages that rewires your brain, and makes you a better programmer in other languages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> Why do you think that such a free, online Clojure course at RubyLearning would be beneficial to the Clojure community?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> There have already been many Ruby programmers exploring Clojure, and it is a natural fit. In my experience, the Ruby community is fearless: tell them there is a better way and they will dive in an see for themselves, rather than becoming defensive.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> How should interested developers go about acquiring knowledge and skills in Clojure? What&#8217;s the best approach?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> Well, there&#8217;s a book. <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a>. And several more books are coming. But really there is no substitute for trying things out. There is a lot going on in Clojure, particularly if you have not been exposed to functional programming, or Lisp, so you have to be patient and let it steep. Also, join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/">mailing list</a>. The community is remarkably friendly and supportive.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael>></strong> Do you see any areas in the language a would-be Clojure programmer should concentrate on?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Stuart>></strong> Clojure&#8217;s approach to values, identity, and <a href="http://clojure.org/state">state</a> is game-changing, and most people will need to spend some time with it to appreciate its power. If you haven&#8217;t already, definitely watch Rich&#8217;s keynote from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">JVM Languages Summit</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#CC3333;"><em>Thank you Stuart. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Stuart would be glad to answer.</em></span>

On the eve of the first free, online “**Clojure 101**” course, Michael
Kohl of RubyLearning caught up with **Stuart Halloway**, author of <!--more-->
[Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure) and
talked to him on **Clojure**, for the benefit of the [Clojure 101
course](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/03/09/clojure-101-a-new-course/)
participants.

**Michael\>\>** Welcome, Stuart and thanks for taking out time for
RubyLearning’s Clojure course participants. For their benefit, could you
tell us something about yourself?

**Stuart\>\>** Along with Justin Gehtland, I co-founded
[Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/), a development shop that takes
pride in staying near the cutting edge. We were early adopters of Ruby
(and Rails), are are now early adopters of Clojure.

**Michael\>\>** How and when did you get involved with Clojure?

**Stuart\>\>** I have been interested in Lisps for years, as a result of
living in Emacs and reading Paul Graham and Steve Yegge. I discovered
Clojure in early 2008, and quickly realized that it was the Lisp I had
been looking for.

**Michael\>\>** You were closely involved with the Ruby language, what
made you switch to Clojure?

**Stuart\>\>** I still use Ruby, but it is fair to say that Clojure is
currently my favorite general-purpose language. In short: I came for the
Lisp, and I stayed for the fp and concurrency features.

**Michael\>\>** Many of RubyLearning’s Clojure course participants have
a Java and or Ruby background. Why, in your opinion, should they learn
Clojure?

**Stuart\>\>** Used well, Clojure will be as fast as Java, as expressive
as Ruby, and more thread-safe and multicore-ready than either. It is
also one of those languages that rewires your brain, and makes you a
better programmer in other languages.

**Michael\>\>** Why do you think that such a free, online Clojure course
at RubyLearning would be beneficial to the Clojure community?

**Stuart\>\>** There have already been many Ruby programmers exploring
Clojure, and it is a natural fit. In my experience, the Ruby community
is fearless: tell them there is a better way and they will dive in an
see for themselves, rather than becoming defensive.

**Michael\>\>** How should interested developers go about acquiring
knowledge and skills in Clojure? What’s the best approach?

**Stuart\>\>** Well, there’s a book.

[Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure). And
several more books are coming. But really there is no substitute for
trying things out. There is a lot going on in Clojure, particularly if
you have not been exposed to functional programming, or Lisp, so you
have to be patient and let it steep. Also, join the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/). The community is
remarkably friendly and supportive.

**Michael\>\>** Do you see any areas in the language a would-be Clojure
programmer should concentrate on?

**Stuart\>\>** Clojure’s approach to values, identity, and
[state](http://clojure.org/state) is game-changing, and most people will
need to spend some time with it to appreciate its power. If you haven’t
already, definitely watch Rich’s keynote from last year’s [JVM Languages
Summit](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey).

*Thank you Stuart. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Stuart
would be glad to answer.*

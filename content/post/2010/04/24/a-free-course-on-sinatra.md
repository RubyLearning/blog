## A Free Course on Sinatra

To celebrate the release of **Sinatra 1.0** RubyLearning announces the
first-ever, free online “**Introduction to Sinatra**” course starting
from **15th May 2010**.

> Sinatra – quickly create tiny web apps and services

## What’s Sinatra?

Sinatra is a micro-framework for quickly creating *tiny
web-applications* and *small services* in Ruby. It is not a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) based framework.

Matters](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html).

**Satish\>\>** Welcome Dmitriy and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Dmitriy\>\>** First of all I want to say Thanks for the opportunity
that RubyLearning gives to people. Personally, saying Thanks to Satish
who drives the site with passion. My name is Dmitriy (Dmytrii or just
Dima), 27 years old guy who is a Software Engineer by profession and in
heart. I made my first steps in IT when I was about 14 years old and
since those days it has become my passion. Sometimes I write things in
my [blog](http://dnagir.blogspot.com/). I love to spend time with people
(and have some beer!), play basketball and enjoy driving a car.
Currently living in Melbourne, though originally came from Ukraine.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Dmitriy\>\>** Most of my professional career I have been a Windows,
C\# / .NET developer and, must admit: sometimes had feelings of love and
hate about it. Though, being working for too long with mostly one
language, it made sense for me to give a try to something new (I mean it
– NEW – not just Java or another kind of same-style language) and give
myself an “educational push”. After reading about different languages
and platforms I decided that I just must go with Linux+Ruby. Ruby is one
of not so many languages that I really “felt” and greatly sympathized
to.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Dmitriy\>\>** This is a bit tough question, but If I could name those
they would probably be:

1.  Metaprogramming – this allows to build great custom DSLs (Shoulda,
    ActiveRecord, RSpec etc etc).
2.  Prototype-based programming – this just switches the way you think
    when comparing to more mainstream languages (C\#, Java). It allows
    to do things in so much easier and better way.
3.  Lambdas/Blocks – needles to say that this feature is probably most
    commonly used in Ruby community which also simplifies the code very
    heavily. Even though Python has similar idiom, it is not the same at
    all and lambdas/blocks are considered to be one of unique Ruby
    features.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Dmitriy\>\>** The broadsides challenge was very unusual in the way it
had to be judged: Truth is in the machine. We had to write bots that
would fight against each other. Apart from number of things I have
learned (working with Enumerables, Arrays, Strings etc) there was an
additional requirement set: understanding unknown opponents. So I had to
figure out the solution that would work as “the best average”. So the
work done for this challenge was very exciting as the challenge itself.

**Satish\>\>** How is the Ruby and Rails scenario in your country
Australia?

**Dmitriy\>\>** It doesn’t feel that Ruby is hitting mainstream yet, but
definitely there is more and more interest in it. There are number of
great people who drive the community. A lot of them can be found in Ruby
On Rails Oceania group. One of the companies here in Melbourne (and
Sydney too) that uses Ruby stack of technologies is ThoughtWorks and
they really seem to have bright guys in there. But generally I feel like
the more Agile-ish a company is the more it is interested in Ruby.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Dmitriy\>\>** Currently I am resigning from my job and planing to
change my career to go alongside with Ruby and step away slowly from C\#
(*so I’m open to job offers*
![:)](http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
).\
 It will be a hard and risky life decision. But I feel like I am ready
to take such a challenge. Hope it will work out well for me.

*Thank you Dmitriy. In case you have any queries and/or questions,
kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and
Dmitriy would be glad to answer.*

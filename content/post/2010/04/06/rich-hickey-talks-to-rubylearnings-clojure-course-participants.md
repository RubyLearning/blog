On the eve of the first free, online “**[Clojure
101](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/03/09/clojure-101-a-new-course/)**”
course, Michael Kohl of RubyLearning caught up with **Rich Hickey**, the
creator of Clojure. In this interview, Rich Hickey talks to the Clojure
101 course participants on **Clojure**.

**Michael\>\>** Welcome, Rich and thanks for taking out time for
RubyLearning’s Clojure course participants. For their benefit, could you
tell us something about yourself?

**Rich\>\>** I’m an independent professional software developer, and the
author of Clojure. For over 2 decades, I’ve worked on a variety of
interesting systems – scheduling, yield management, broadcast
automation, digital audio etc.

**Michael\>\>** Why and when did you decide to start working on Clojure?

**Rich\>\>** I decided I couldn’t stay interested for 2 more decades if
I had to keep writing software in C-derived languages like C++/Java/C\#.
I guess I first committed to creating a language in 2005. I wrote
Clojure because, having great affection for Lisp, I hadn’t been able to
come up with a satisfying way to bridge Common Lisp and the platforms on
which I had to deliver systems – the JVM and .Net. In addition, I’d
decided I wanted to program in a language that was more oriented towards
functional programming than traditional Lisps.

**Michael\>\>** Many of RubyLearning’s Clojure course participants have
a Java and or Ruby background. What, according to you, are the benefits
to these participants after learning Clojure?

**Rich\>\>** I think everyone can benefit by taking a more functional
approach to programming. The more you use immutable data and pure
functions, in any programming language, the simpler and more robust your
programs will be. Clojure makes that idiomatic and relatively
approachable.

**Michael\>\>** How should our users go about acquiring knowledge and
skills in Clojure? What’s the best approach?

**Rich\>\>** Everyone learns differently. I would encourage people to
get Programming Clojure, and any other available Clojure books. Try
things out at the REPL – the interactive learning experience is great.
Look at code in Clojure and various libraries. and don’t miss out on the
terrific community on the Clojure google group and \#clojure IRC
channel.

**Michael\>\>** Which areas in Clojure should a would-be Clojure
programmer concentrate on in your opinion?

**Rich\>\>** If you are coming from an OO background, the most
fundamental thing is to concentrate on programming with values. Don’t
try to replicate your mutable objects, you need them far less than you
might think.

**Michael\>\>** Do you think this free online course at RubyLearning
will be beneficial to the Clojure community?

**Rich\>\>** I hope so!

**Michael\>\>** After the course, most participants would like to
contribute their time, skills and expertise to a Clojure project but
invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Do you have any
suggestions for them?

**Rich\>\>** Get engaged with the community on the Clojure google group,
find libraries that are useful to you, use them, then see if you have
something to add and coordinate with the library author.

**Michael\>\>** Do you have any parting words for our Clojure course
participants? Anything you would like to share with them?

**Rich\>\>** Clojure is based on the idea that programming can and
should be much less complex. Once you get past any unfamiliarity, I hope
you come to cherish the simplicity that underlies it.

*Thank you Rich. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Rich would
be glad to answer.*

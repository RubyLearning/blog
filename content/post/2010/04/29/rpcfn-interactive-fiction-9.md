    About Avdi Grimm
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="Avdi Grimm" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/avdi.jpg" alt="Avdi Grimm" />Avdi Grimm is a husband, father, software cultivator living in southern Pennsylvania, USA. He has been been working with the Ruby language for almost ten years, and is still finding new reasons to love it. He is the author of <a href="http://github.com/nulldb/nulldb">NullDB</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/hammertime-ruby-interactive-error-console-2942.html">Hammertime</a>, <a href="http://github.com/avdi/alter-ego">AlterEgo</a>, <a href="http://github.com/avdi/hookr">HookR</a> and <a href="http://github.com/avdi">numerous other Rubygems</a> and has contributed code to Gemcutter, UtilityBelt, the DataMapper/SimpleDB adapter, and other projects. He writes about Ruby and software development at his blog <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/">Virtuous Code</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Avdi has this to say about the challenge:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>One of the hardest parts of getting started with a new programming language is picking problems to practice on. The problems need to be difficult enough to give you an opportunity to apply the features of the language, but small enough to complete in a reasonable amount of time. RPCFN is a great way to find practice problems which have been scoped to that &#8220;just right&#8221; size by experienced Rubyists. Complete these challenges and you will be sure to gain confidence and proficiency in the Ruby language.</em>
    </p>

In this brief interview, Satish Talim of RubyLearning talks to **[Paul

Programming Challenge For
Newbies](2010/04/07/rpcfn-xml-transformer---8/).<!--more-->

**Satish\>\>** Welcome Paul and thanks for taking out time to share your
thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something
about your self?

**Paul\>\>** Sure, I’m a Web Developer from Baltimore, MD. I’ve been
doing web development for over 10 years in a variety of languages and
frameworks including Perl, PHP, Java and Ruby.

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Paul\>\>** I got started with Ruby programming the same way I suspect
many other Ruby developers did, which is through Rails. At the time
Rails hit the scene, I was pretty entrenched as a Java developer. My
initial reaction to Rails was that it seemed to have a lot of good ideas
in it, but I figured we could find a way to implement those idea in
Java. The more I dug into Rails, the more I realized that it was the
Ruby language that made the clear, powerful abstractions that make up
Rails possible and that I could use Ruby to create useful abstractions
in my own code as well.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Paul\>\>**

1.  **Blocks**: The best thing about blocks is that when you first start
    using Ruby, Ruby’s block syntax gets you to start using anonymous
    functions and higher-order functions all over the place in your code
    without even realizing it.
2.  **Everything is an object**: This is makes some aspects of the
    language simple to understand in that everything follows a few
    simple rules. String, Integers, Regexs, and most importantly
    Classes, are all just objects, just data, that you can manipulate at
    runtime.
3.  **Class definitions**: These are just expressions that are evaluated
    at runtime, expressions that have access to the class that is being
    defined. This allows you to create methods that when called will
    generate other methods, such as has\_many in Rails.

When you put these three features together, you have a metaprogramming
environment that I would argue is as powerful as what Lisp macros give
you, although I’m sure there are some hardcore Lisp programmers out
there that would disagree with me.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Paul\>\>** I’ve really enjoyed it. It’s a great exercise to come up
with a solution to a problem and then be able to compare your solution
to what other developers came up with. Most of the challenges so far
have been just the right size, which is hard enough to make you think
about it, but short enough to where you can work out an interesting
solution without having to invest too much time in it.

**Satish\>\>** You are based in Baltimore, USA. How is the Ruby and
Rails scenario there?

**Paul\>\>** Baltimore has a great Ruby and Rails community. Of course,
[RailsConf](http://www.railsconf.com/) is coming to town, which we’re
all excited about. Many of us that are part of the [B’More on Rails
group](http://bmoreonrails.org/), are working on various initiatives to
make sure everyone has a great time at RailsConf. The Baltimore Ruby on
Rails group has a bunch of smart people that meet regularly at various
events. We’re always trying to do everything we can to help new people
become part of the community as well. There’s also a lot of overlap with
the DC/Northern Virginia communities which are close by and very good as
well.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Paul\>\>** I’m going to Disneyland!

Just kidding. There is so much stuff I want to learn more about, it’s
hard to find time for all of it. I really like where Rails is going with
Rails 3. As much as I love Ruby, I’m also interested in other languages
as well, especially functional ones like OCaml, Erlang, Clojure, Scala
and Haskell. I think asynchronous IO/evented frameworks like Node.js and
EventMachine provide a better model for building network servers.
Technologies like XMPP and the WebSocket API that’s part of HTML5 are
also going to be key in the next generation of real-time, connected web
and mobile applications.

*Thank you Paul. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Paul would
be glad to answer.*

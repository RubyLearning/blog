## Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies

### RPCFN: Cycle Tracks (\#12)

-- By David Griffiths

Today, we complete one year of **Ruby Programming Challenge for
Newbies**. RubyLearning is grateful to all the Ruby experts and
participants who have actively helped make these challenges interesting
and popular.<!--more-->

## About David Griffiths

![David
Griffiths](http://rubylearning.com/images/Dg_on_beach.png "David Griffiths")
In David’s own words: “I’m an agile developer, writer and trainer based
in the UK. I used to write a monthly Java development column and I’ve
used and taught agile methods to companies around the UK. But I’ve been
writing code since I was 12 years old. I worked with Java from the alpha
release in the 90s. A lot of things on the client side as well as a lot
of enterprise stuff. But everything changed for me when I got an early
copy of Bruce Tate’s Up and Running with Ruby on Rails. I found myself
in Boston for 3 days with nothing else to do. And anyone who’s been to
Boston knows that it’s famous for two things: coffee and book shops. So
I got a copy of Tate’s book and a laptop and spent three days burying
myself deep into Rails and consuming more caffeine than was probably
wise. It was incredible. Here was a way of doing things with a few
simple commands, that would have taken 19 classes, an enterprise
container and 3-400 lines of XML in Java. An old professor once told me
“The profound is always simple” – and Rails was the living embodiment of
that. I was hooked. It really hasn’t been the same since.”

## Prizes

-   The participant with the best Ruby solution (if there is a tie
    between answers, then the one who posted first will be the winner)
    will be awarded any **one** of PeepCode’s [Ruby on Rails
    screencasts](http://peepcode.com/screencasts/ruby-on-rails).
-   From the remaining working Ruby solutions, three participants would
    be selected randomly and each one would be awarded any **one** of
    Pragmatic’s [The Ruby Object Model and
    Metaprogramming](http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming)
    screencasts.

The four persons who win, can’t win again in the next immediate
challenge but can still participate.

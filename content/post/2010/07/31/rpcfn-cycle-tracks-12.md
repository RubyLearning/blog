    About David Griffiths
  </h3>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignright" title="David Griffiths" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/Dg_on_beach.png" alt="David Griffiths" /> In David&#8217;s own words: &#8220;I&#8217;m an agile developer, writer and trainer based in the UK. I used to write a monthly Java development column and I&#8217;ve used and taught agile methods to companies around the UK. But I&#8217;ve been writing code since I was 12 years old. I worked with Java from the alpha release in the 90s. A lot of things on the client side as well as a lot of enterprise stuff. But everything changed for me when I got an early copy of Bruce Tate&#8217;s Up and Running with Ruby on Rails. I found myself in Boston for 3 days with nothing else to do. And anyone who&#8217;s been to Boston knows that it&#8217;s famous for two things: coffee and book shops. So I got a copy of Tate&#8217;s book and a laptop and spent three days burying myself deep into Rails and consuming more caffeine than was probably wise. It was incredible. Here was a way of doing things with a few simple commands, that would have taken 19 classes, an enterprise container and 3-400 lines of XML in Java. An old professor once told me &#8220;The profound is always simple&#8221; &#8211; and Rails was the living embodiment of that. I was hooked. It really hasn&#8217;t been the same since.&#8221;

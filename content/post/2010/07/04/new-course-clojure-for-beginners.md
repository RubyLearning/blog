    <span class="drop_cap">I</span>ntroducing an intensive, online course for <em>beginners</em> that helps you get started with <strong>Clojure</strong> programming.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What&#8217;s Clojure?
  </h3>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Wikipedia</a>: &#8220;Clojure is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a general-purpose language supporting interactive development that encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies multithreaded programming. Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine and the Common Language Runtime. Clojure honors the code-as-data philosophy and has a sophisticated Lisp macro system.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Stuart Halloway</b> in his <b><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a></b> book says &#8211; &#8220;Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back from the near future. Its support for functional programming and software trans-actional memory is well beyond current practice and is well suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history of programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries, and tooling of the dominant platform available today.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b><a href="http://programmingzen.com/2010/07/09/thoughts-on-clojure/">Antonio Cangiano</a></b> says: &#8220;Clojure has three main advantages over Ruby:&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      It&#8217;s much faster than Ruby, which makes it a better choice for intensive processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      It greatly simplifies concurrent programming, making the language more future-proof as hardware manufacturers continue to produce processors with more CPU cores.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clojure emphasizes functional programming and tries to minimize side effects.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>
    What Will I Learn?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In this introductory course, you will learn the <a href="http://clojure-notes.rubylearning.org/">essential features of Clojure</a> that you will end up using every day.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Who&#8217;s It For?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>An <em>absolute beginner</em> in Lisp and / or Clojure but with some experience in other programming languages</b>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Mentor
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    Michael Kohl
  </h4>
  
  <p class="block">
    <img class="alignleft" title="Michael Kohl" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/michael_kohl.jpg" alt="Michael Kohl" />Michael Kohl (<a href="http://twitter.com/citizen428">Twitter</a> / <a href="http://citizen428.net/">blog</a>) in his day job, works as a Ruby on Rails programmer for <a href="http://tupalo.com/">Tupalo.com</a> in Vienna, Austria. Michael fell in love with Clojure on first sight sometime in early 2009, but unfortunately never seems to have as much time to work with it as he wants to and started being a mentor for <a href="http://www.rubylearning.org/class/">RubyLearning.org</a> in early 2009. His interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign languages, chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn&#8217;t need to sleep.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Dates
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The course starts on Monday, 19th July 2010 and runs for a week.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Course Fees
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The course fee is <b>US$ 5</b> and the entire course fee will be <a href="http://clojure.org/funding">donated to the Clojure project</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hurry, registrations have started. <b>The course will be restricted to 25 participants only</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p class="alert">
    At the end of this course you should have all the knowledge to explore the wonderful world of Clojure on your own.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    How do I register?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You first need to <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">register on the site</a> and then <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=57">enroll into the course</a>.

Introducing an intensive, online course for *beginners* that helps you
get started with **Clojure** programming.

## What’s Clojure?

![Clojure](http://clojure.org/file/view/clojure-icon.gif "Clojure")

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure): “Clojure
is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a
general-purpose language supporting interactive development that
encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies multithreaded
programming. Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine and the Common
Language Runtime. Clojure honors the code-as-data philosophy and has a
sophisticated Lisp macro system.”

**Stuart Halloway** in his **[Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure)**
book says – “Clojure feels like a general-purpose language beamed back
from the near future. Its support for functional programming and
software trans-actional memory is well beyond current practice and is
well suited for multicore hardware. At the same time, Clojure is well
grounded in the past and the present. It brings together Lisp and the
Java Virtual Machine. Lisp brings wisdom spanning most of the history of
programming, and Java brings the robustness, extensive libraries, and
tooling of the dominant platform available today.”

**[Antonio
Cangiano](http://programmingzen.com/2010/07/09/thoughts-on-clojure/)**
says: “Clojure has three main advantages over Ruby:”

1.  It’s much faster than Ruby, which makes it a better choice for
    intensive processing.
2.  It greatly simplifies concurrent programming, making the language
    more future-proof as hardware manufacturers continue to produce
    processors with more CPU cores.
3.  Clojure emphasizes functional programming and tries to minimize side
    effects.

## What Will I Learn?

In this introductory course, you will learn the [essential features of
Clojure](http://clojure-notes.rubylearning.org/) that you will end up
using every day.

## Who’s It For?

**An *absolute beginner* in Lisp and / or Clojure but with some
experience in other programming languages**.

## Mentor

### Michael Kohl

![Michael
Kohl](http://rubylearning.com/images/michael_kohl.jpg "Michael Kohl")Michael
Kohl ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/citizen428) /
[blog](http://citizen428.net/)) in his day job, works as a Ruby on Rails
programmer for [Tupalo.com](http://tupalo.com/) in Vienna, Austria.
Michael fell in love with Clojure on first sight sometime in early 2009,
but unfortunately never seems to have as much time to work with it as he
wants to and started being a mentor for
[RubyLearning.org](http://www.rubylearning.org/class/) in early 2009.
His interests include mathematics, literature, travelling, foreign
languages, chess and so much more that he really wishes he wouldn’t need
to sleep.

## Dates

The course starts on Monday, 19th July 2010 and runs for a week.

## Course Fees

The course fee is **US\$ 5** and the entire course fee will be [donated
to the Clojure project](http://clojure.org/funding).

Hurry, registrations have started. **The course will be restricted to 25
participants only**.

At the end of this course you should have all the knowledge to explore
the wonderful world of Clojure on your own.

## How do I register?

You first need to [register on the site](http://rubylearning.org/) and
then [enroll into the
course](http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=57).

![Update](http://rubylearning.com/images/update.jpg "Update")

Many of you wrote in asking for details on how the course works. Here
are some details:

### Important:

Once the course starts, you can login and start with the lessons **any
day and time** and post your queries in the forum under the relevant
lessons. Someone shall always be there to answer them. Just to set the
expectations correctly, there is no real-time ‘webcasting’.

### Methodology:

-   The Mentors shall give you URL’s of pages and sometimes some
    additional notes; you need to read through. Read the pre-class
    reading material at a convenient time of your choice – the dates may
    be specified only as a guideline. While reading, please make a note
    of all your doubts, queries, questions, clarifications, comments
    about the lesson and after you have completed all the pages, post
    these on the forum **under the relevant lesson**. There may be some
    questions that relate to something that has not been mentioned or
    discussed by the mentors thus far; you could post the same too.
    Please remember that with every post, do mention the operating
    system of your computer.
-   The mentor shall highlight the important points that you need to
    remember for that day’s session.
-   There could be exercises every day. Please do them.
-   Participate in the forum for asking and answering questions or
    starting discussions. Share knowledge, and exchange ideas amongst
    yourselves during the course period. Participants are strongly
    encouraged to post technical questions, interesting articles, tools,
    sample programs or anything that is relevant to the class / lesson.
    Please do not post a simple "Thank you" note or "Hello" message to
    the forum. This forum is subscribed by several people, so please be
    aware that these messages are considered as noises by many people.

### Outline of Work Expectations:

1.  Most of the days, you will have exercises to solve. These are there
    to help you assimilate whatever you have learned till then.
2.  Some days may have some additional assignments / food for thought
    articles / programs
3.  **Above all, do participate in the relevant forums. Past
    participants will confirm that they learned the best by active
    participation.**

### Some Commonly Asked Questions

-   **Qs.** Is there any specific time when I need to be online?\
    **Ans.** No. You need not be online at a specific time of the day.
-   **Qs.** Is it important for me to participate in the course forums?\
    **Ans.** YES. You must Participate in the forum(s) for asking and
    answering questions or starting discussions. Share knowledge, and
    exchange ideas amongst yourselves (participants) during the course
    period. Participants are strongly encouraged to post technical
    questions, interesting articles, tools, sample programs or anything
    that is relevant to the class / lesson. Past participants will
    confirm that they learned the best by active participation.
-   **Qs.** How much time do I need to spend online for a course, in a
    day?\
    **Ans.** This will vary from person to person. All depends upon your
    comfort level and the amount of time you want to spend on a
    particular lesson or task.
-   **Qs.** Is there any specific set time for feedback (e.g., any
    mentor responds to me within 24 hours?)\
    **Ans.** Normally somebody should answer your query / question
    within 24 hours.
-   **Qs.** What happens if nobody answers my questions / queries?\
    **Ans.** Normally, that will not happen. In case you feel that your
    question / query is not answered, then please post the same in the
    thread – “Any UnAnswered Questions / Queries”.
-   **Qs.** What happens to the class (or forums) after a course is
    over? Can you keep it open for a few more days so that students can
    complete and discuss too?\
    **Ans.** The course and its forum is open for a month after the last
    day of the course.
-   **Qs.** How do I quit from a course?\
    **Ans.** We wouldn’t like that to happen. However, in case you want
    to ‘quit’ from a course or for some reason want to un-subscribe,
    kindly message Satish Talim or email him at **satish.talim [at]
    gmail [dot] com**

Remember, the idea is to have fun learning Clojure.

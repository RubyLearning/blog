    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Welcome Dmitry and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong> Hey. My name is Dmitry, and I&#8217;ve been programming since I was 14 years old, when I made my first &#8220;Hello World&#8221; in Pascal work. I&#8217;m absolutely sure that programming should be fun if you&#8217;re not doing something wrong <img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How did you get involved with Ruby programming?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong> About one and a half years back I discovered Ryan Bates&#8217; RailsCasts. It was really inspiring, so I started to look at how these things work. That was my first Ruby experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then I read a few articles on TDD/BDD in Ruby and that was the point of no return. It was so easy and natural in comparison with my Java experience that I haven&#8217;t stopped playing with it since then.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      I like Ruby for its pure object oriented approach. I mean, for example Java and many other mainstream languages are more &#8220;class oriented&#8221;. They have classes as something special, as their main idea. But Ruby is different. Object is the center of the universe in Ruby and not class. And it&#8217;s really great.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Blocks</b>. Definitely one of the most useful things in Ruby. Maybe it&#8217;s not a unique feature, but it really rocks!
    </li>
    <li>
      Although it&#8217;s not a plain feature of the language, I very much like Ruby&#8217;s approach to testing. The Ruby community is considered as the &#8220;most testing community&#8221; and I like that. Testing makes it easy to dig into a new project when you try to understand how things work, how they should be used. And almost any open source Ruby project has a good test suite.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong> It reminds me of the good old days when I participated in ICPC. Quite fun.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Actually not so many challenges judge your code. And I&#8217;m glad to see that for RPCFN code beauty is important.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also it was nice to discover other solutions and see the different approaches to the problem. Some of them are really worth looking into.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> You are based in Russia. How is the Ruby and Rails scenario there?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong> Unfortunately Ruby isn&#8217;t much popular here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Nevertheless the community is growing little by little and I can see that a couple of projects, here and there, use Ruby. But it&#8217;s still nothing in comparison with PHP or Java.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Satish>></strong> What are your future plans?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Dmitry>></strong> In the near future I&#8217;d like to move from Java to Ruby completely; dig deeper into the Rails 3 source and participate in other open source Ruby projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, I&#8217;m going to participate in Gregory Brown&#8217;s Ruby Mendicant University this autumn. And I would like to thank him for such an opportunity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="color:#0000FF;"><em>Thank you Dmitry. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Dmitry would be glad to answer.</em></span>

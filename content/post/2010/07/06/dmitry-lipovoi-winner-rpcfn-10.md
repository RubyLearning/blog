**Satish\>\>** Welcome Dmitry and thanks for taking out time to share
your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?

**Dmitry\>\>** Hey. My name is Dmitry, and I’ve been programming since I
was 14 years old, when I made my first “Hello World” in Pascal work. I’m
absolutely sure that programming should be fun if you’re not doing
something wrong

**Satish\>\>** How did you get involved with Ruby programming?

**Dmitry\>\>** About one and a half years back I discovered Ryan Bates’
RailsCasts. It was really inspiring, so I started to look at how these
things work. That was my first Ruby experience.

Then I read a few articles on TDD/BDD in Ruby and that was the point of
no return. It was so easy and natural in comparison with my Java
experience that I haven’t stopped playing with it since then.

**Satish\>\>** Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the
most, as compared to other languages? Why?

**Dmitry\>\>**

1.  I like Ruby for its pure object oriented approach. I mean, for
    example Java and many other mainstream languages are more “class
    oriented”. They have classes as something special, as their main
    idea. But Ruby is different. Object is the center of the universe in
    Ruby and not class. And it’s really great.
2.  **Blocks**. Definitely one of the most useful things in Ruby. Maybe
    it’s not a unique feature, but it really rocks!
3.  Although it’s not a plain feature of the language, I very much like
    Ruby’s approach to testing. The Ruby community is considered as the
    “most testing community” and I like that. Testing makes it easy to
    dig into a new project when you try to understand how things work,
    how they should be used. And almost any open source Ruby project has
    a good test suite.

**Satish\>\>** How was experience of taking part in the Ruby Programming
Challenge For Newbies (RPCFN)?

**Dmitry\>\>** It reminds me of the good old days when I participated in
ICPC. Quite fun.

Actually not so many challenges judge your code. And I’m glad to see
that for RPCFN code beauty is important.

Also it was nice to discover other solutions and see the different
approaches to the problem. Some of them are really worth looking into.

**Satish\>\>** You are based in Russia. How is the Ruby and Rails
scenario there?

**Dmitry\>\>** Unfortunately Ruby isn’t much popular here.

Nevertheless the community is growing little by little and I can see
that a couple of projects, here and there, use Ruby. But it’s still
nothing in comparison with PHP or Java.

**Satish\>\>** What are your future plans?

**Dmitry\>\>** In the near future I’d like to move from Java to Ruby
completely; dig deeper into the Rails 3 source and participate in other
open source Ruby projects.

Also, I’m going to participate in Gregory Brown’s Ruby Mendicant
University this autumn. And I would like to thank him for such an
opportunity.

*Thank you Dmitry. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Dmitry
would be glad to answer.*

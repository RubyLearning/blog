## Ruby with Shoes Course – 7th Batch

RubyLearning has so far successfully conducted six batches of the Ruby
with Shoes course. We are now announcing the 7th batch.

## What’s Shoes?

The extraordinaire Rubyist “Why The Lucky Stiff”
(\_why)^[1](#fn-4061-1)^ had been working energetically on
[Shoes](http://shoes.heroku.com/), a Ruby Cross Platform GUI App
Toolkit. Shoes is simple and straightforward.

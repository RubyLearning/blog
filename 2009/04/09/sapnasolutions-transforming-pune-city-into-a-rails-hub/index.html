            <p><strong>Nick Adams</strong> is the CTO and Co-Founder of <strong>SapnaSolutions</strong>.
SapnaSolutions is on a mission of transforming Pune city into a Ruby on
Rails hub.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/NickAdams.png" alt="Nick
Adams" title="Nick Adams" />
</p>

<p><strong>Satish Talim&gt;&gt;</strong> Nick, could you tell us something about yourself –
your background, where you are based?</p>

<p><strong>Nick Adams&gt;&gt;</strong> I came to India in early 2008 to seek my fortunes
with <a href="http://www.entrip.com/">EnTrip</a>, our web based travel portal. My
friend Anthony and I decided to do something doubly different and start
a company in another country rather than work in London after we
graduated. We joined forces with Yann, a French entrepreneur with
experience at StudiVZ, to create
<strong><a href="http://sapnasolutions.com/en">SapnaSolutions</a></strong> earlier this year
here in Pune, India.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/SapnaSolutions.jpg" alt="SapnaSolutions" title="SapnaSolutions" />
</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> Could you tell us a little more about SapnaSolutions?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> SapnaSolutions is a new kind of development company.
Although we will use our European links to take outsourced work, we also
have a number of product and marketable web 2.0 ideas which we plan to
implement alongside our client work. Those products, one of which we are
working on at the moment, we hope to scale, and build the company
eventually into a Web 2.0 hot house. It makes the company atmosphere
electric, more like one of a start-up, than an ordinary development
company.</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> Nick, why did you choose Ruby on Rails (RoR) as a
framework for development work at SapnaSolutions?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> I have been working in Rails since early 2007 when I used
it to create the first prototype of ‘Trip’, which would later turn into
EnTrip. Ever since then, I’ve watched RoR and the community and the buzz
surrounding it grow and mature, and since most of the scalability issues
have been resolved, there seems no better framework on which to build a
new forward thinking web company.</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> Were there any surprises in working with RoR?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> Many, mostly pleasant! I remember when I was learning Ruby
and Rails, I continuously found myself surprised by how much ‘just
worked’. It’s mostly down to the elegance and power of Ruby, of course,
which is how most of the Rails magic is possible. One thing that’s
slightly surprising now is that Merb, a powerful and yet tight framework
is merging with the full and often thought of as bloated Rails 2.2
stack. I am very interested to see what will emerge and how easy
migration will be; hopefully that will be yet another pleasant surprise!</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> What is your impression about the RoR scene in India and
especially in Pune, where your development center is based?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> When we started recruiting it was tough but once we got our
HR machine going we found that there are quite a number of RoR
developers available for hire in India. Unfortunately, the web geek
nature that is found in the active community surrounding Rails, is not
here yet. In India software is still seen largely as a tool, either for
a better paid job or for doing the bidding of a project manager. We are
yet to see the real interest in the web and in contributing to
technology that is needed in order for India to fully utilise the power
of it’s thousands of web developers. Here in Pune we are lucky to have
India’s first Ruby university course, and a number of companies using
RoR. A number of our developers have joined us from Pune, I think we are
set to have the city emerge as a strong contender to lead a new
generation of web savvy developers in India.</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> What advice would you give startups about platform
choices?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> What do you know? Choose something you are comfortable
with. A strong link between business and tech is important, so you can
assess quickly what is possible, how long it will take, and what the
cost will be. Knowing the technology you work with is a real benefit.
What is free? I would advise any startup to go open source, because it’s
free and because the communities in open source technologies are very
strong. What is fast? Choose the platforms that let you get your ideas
out there quickly, so the time to market and time to feedback is faster.
I would give a big thumbs up for Rails in this category – once you know
it, even challenging web apps are a breeze.</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> Getting back to SapnaSolutions, what are your future
plans?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> We intend to get going with client projects, and eventually
scale our products. We believe we are at a unique advantage by being
able to speak five different European languages in house, which allow us
to take projects from clients typically outside the Indian market, and
also build applications and products for emerging markets in Europe. My
own dream is to take EnTrip, my own startup forward, after a short lull
in development, which we expect to be possible as soon as we are up and
running with Sapna.</p>

<p><strong>Satish&gt;&gt;</strong> Anything else you would like to add?</p>

<p><strong>Nick&gt;&gt;</strong> Yes, thanks for everything you’re doing for the Ruby
community here in Pune Satish! The next challenge is engaging people
with it’s many applications, the Web being a very exciting such
application.</p>

<p><em>Thank you Nick. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly
post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Nick would
be glad to answer.</em></p>

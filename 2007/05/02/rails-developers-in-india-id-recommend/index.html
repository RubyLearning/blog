            <p>Like <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-developers-id-recommend-for-your-projects-467.html">Peter
Cooper</a>,
I too constantly get emails from various readers of
<a href="http://rubylearning.com/">RubyLearning.com</a>, who are looking for
<strong>Rails developers in India</strong> for their projects. As I don’t do this
myself, I have to keep giving out a list of Rails developers I know and
trust or have had good feedback about.</p>

<p>My previous blog post <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/04/24/ruby-on-rails-in-india/">Ruby on Rails in
India</a>
just lists down all the companies working in Rails in India.</p>

<p>Here, I am listing down companies (in no particular order) I’d recommend
and will keep it updated as a resource for everyone to use.</p>

<p>If you have worked with any of these companies or with some company not
listed here, <em>please do comment about your experience and why you would
recommend or not recommend that company.</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Disclaimer: None of these companies has ever paid me anything and none
requested this post.. just to be clear!)</em></p>

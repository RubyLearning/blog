&lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/classes/enrol/index.php?id=63&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/paypal_ruby.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Paypal&#34; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/data/AdviceRuby.zip&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Advice for Ruby
Beginners&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; as a .zip file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what &lt;strong&gt;Sandra Randall (Butler)&lt;/strong&gt;, a participant who just
graduated, has to say - &amp;ldquo;You kindly offered me the opportunity to join
your Ruby course. I&amp;rsquo;m new to development and found the course, even
though basic for programmers, a little tricky for me. I managed to
complete all of the assessments and really learnt a lot. Thank you very
much for the opportunity. It has really given me the push I needed to
learn Ruby and I&amp;rsquo;m currently treading my way through both the pickaxe
and Agile Development books and enjoying it. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been offered
a position as a Junior Systems Developer at a local Software house in
South Africa - all thanks to the push you gave me which gave me the
motivation and drive to get going.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-ruby:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Ruby?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/ruby_350.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ruby&#34; title=&#34;Modified for display - License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&#34;&gt;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Ruby is
a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
and productivity. Ruby&amp;rsquo;s elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to
write.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto&lt;/strong&gt;, the creator of Ruby, in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html&#34;&gt;an
interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
says -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They
don&amp;rsquo;t want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel
natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and
concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use
Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-i-learn:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;What Will I Learn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ruby programming course, you will learn the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html&#34;&gt;essential features
of Ruby&lt;/a&gt; that you
will end up using every day. You will also be introduced to Git, GitHub,
HTTP concepts, RubyGems, Rack and Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-highlights:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;Some Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rubylearning-s-irc-channel:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;RubyLearning&amp;rsquo;s IRC Channel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the mentors and students hang out at RubyLearning&amp;rsquo;s IRC
(irc.freenode.net) channel (#rubylearning.org) for both technical and
non-technical discussions. Everyone benefits with the active discussions
on Ruby with the mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-hangouts:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Hangout Event that is open for students, for drop-in hangouts
where students can pair program with mentors or with each other. This is
often where you can get help with your system, editor, and general
environment. Anything that can help you with your coding environment
that you are having problems with are usually discussed interactively
here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;git-repositories:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;Git Repositories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared (private) repositories available for those that want to learn git
and the revision controlled programming workflow. This allows students
that want to collaborate while learning. This is a great way to record
your progress while learning Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ebook:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;eBook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is based on the &lt;strong&gt;The Ultimate Guide to Ruby Programming&lt;/strong&gt;
eBook. This book is &lt;a href=&#34;http://book.rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;priced at US $9.95&lt;/a&gt;.
However, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062X2I68/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0062X2I68&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=satishtalimsw-20&#34;&gt;Kindle
edition&lt;/a&gt;
of the eBook is available for US $6.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges-and-side-tracks:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;Challenges and Side Tracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is course material not found in the RubyLearning Study Notes nor in
the E-Book! Depending on participation levels, we throw a Ruby coding
challenge in the mix, right for the level we are at. We have been known
to give out a prize or two for the &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-s-it-for:0abd26cdb3a9774f40682720c8206489&#34;&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s It For?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;beginner&lt;/em&gt; with some knowledge of programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read what past participants / online magazines have to say about
the course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;
    With &lt;strong&gt;Sinatra&lt;/strong&gt; you can quickly create your own tiny web-applications in Ruby and write lots of small services.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Problem definition
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    To upload a text file to a &lt;strong&gt;Sinatra web service&lt;/strong&gt; and have its sorted content returned.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    How to upload a file from the command line?
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    We shall use &lt;strong&gt;cURL&lt;/strong&gt;, a tool and library designed to give you a user-friendly but low-level interface to making HTTP requests. cURL also supports many other protocols related to uploading and downloading files.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In case you have not used cURL, please read the brief note &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/blog/do-you-know-how-to-use-curl/&#34;&gt;Do you know how to use cURL?&lt;/a&gt;. It explains how you can download, install and use cURL.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The actual command from the command prompt to upload a text file to a &lt;em&gt;Sinatra web service&lt;/em&gt; is:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;curl -F &#34;info=@alpha.txt&#34; localhost:4567/sorter&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Let&amp;#8217;s look at the above command in more detail:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The cURL -F option lets cURL emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data. This also enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the &amp;#8216;content&amp;#8217; part to be a file, we prefix the file name with an @ sign.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      alpha.txt is our text file to be uploaded. You can check the contents of this file &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/data/alpha.txt&#34;&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      info is the name of the form-field to which alpha.txt will be the input.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Our Sinatra web service will be running on localhost:4567/sorter
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Sorter Sinatra Web Service
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Our &lt;em&gt;Sinatra web service&lt;/em&gt; is very simple. The contents of the program &lt;b&gt;sorter.rb&lt;/b&gt; are:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;# sorter.rb
require &#39;sinatra&#39;

# Usage: curl -F &#34;info=@alpha.txt&#34; localhost:4567/sorter
post &#39;/sorter&#39; do
  params[:info][:tempfile].readlines.sort
end&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Handler is the generic term that Sinatra uses for the &amp;#8220;controllers&amp;#8221;. A handler is the initial point of entry for new HTTP requests into your application. In handlers you can reach submitted form parameters directly via the &lt;b&gt;params&lt;/b&gt; hash. The support of Rails like nested parameters is built-in since Sinatra. Therefore in handlers you can use nested parameters like a regular hash: &lt;b&gt;params[:info][:tempfile]&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The Ruby method &lt;b&gt;readlines&lt;/b&gt; reads the entire file as individual lines and returns those lines in an array.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The &lt;b&gt;Array.sort&lt;/b&gt; method, sorts our array contents.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Starting the Sorter Sinatra Web Service
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Open a new command window and change the folder to the folder that contains your file &amp;#8211; &lt;b&gt;sorter.rb&lt;/b&gt;. Next type:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;ruby sorter.rb&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Now open another command window and change the folder to the folder that contains your file &amp;#8211; &lt;b&gt;alpha.txt&lt;/b&gt;. Next type in our cURL command, namely:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;curl -F &#34;info=@alpha.txt&#34; localhost:4567/sorter&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The command window where you typed in your cURL command should get the results, namely:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;apple
birthday
cat
pune
xmas
yen
zebra&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;h4&gt;
    Use my Sorter Sinatra Web Service
  &lt;/h4&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For your pleasure, I have created the Sorter &lt;em&gt;Sinatra Web Service&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudcontrol.com&#34;&gt;cloudControl&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s free). You can use this &lt;em&gt;Sorter Sinatra Web Service&lt;/em&gt; service anytime you want. Open a command window and change your folder to the folder containing the file &lt;b&gt;alpha.txt&lt;/b&gt;. Next type in the following cURL command:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;curl -F &#34;info=@alpha.txt&#34; http://curlsorter.cloudcontrolled.com/sorter&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The command window where you typed in this cURL command should display the desired results.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFCC;&#34;&gt;Remember to have fun with &lt;strong&gt;Sinatra&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h4&gt;
    Credits
  &lt;/h4&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

      <title>Can YOU suggest new course contents?</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/19/can-you-suggest-new-course-contents/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/19/can-you-suggest-new-course-contents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re rapidly expanding our course offerings here at RubyLearning,
trying to keep up with the enormous and ever-growing interest in
“everything” &lt;strong&gt;Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. We have recently introduced four new courses
namely: “Using Twitter with Ruby”, “Introduction to Sinatra”,
“Introduction to FXRuby” and “Git &amp;amp; GitHub”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant demand at RubyLearning has been for a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;, introductory
course on “&lt;strong&gt;Ruby Networking and the Internet&lt;/strong&gt;“. This could broadly
cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking Concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Network Operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients and Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP and the Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EMail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need your &lt;strong&gt;YOUR&lt;/strong&gt; help, because as you know this is a big
subject and we’d like to be sure to focus in on the areas of most
interest to &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please post your suggestions as comments to this blog post&lt;/strong&gt;. It
won’t take more than a minute or two.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview: Chris Wanstrath of GitHub</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/02/21/interview-chris-wanstrath-of-github/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/02/21/interview-chris-wanstrath-of-github/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the first ever free, online course on “Git and GitHub”,
Satish Talim of RubyLearning caught up with &lt;strong&gt;Chris Wanstrath&lt;/strong&gt; and
talked to him, in this short interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/ChrisWanstrath.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chris Wanstrath,
USA&#34; title=&#34;Chris Wanstrath, USA&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome, Chris and thanks for taking out time to
share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us
something about your self?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Wanstrath&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a Ruby and JavaScript programmer living in
San Francisco, CA. &lt;em&gt;I was one of the guys who started &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. When
I’m not working on the site, I can be found playing guitar or drinking
bourbon. Sometimes at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Why according to you, is it important for a new Ruby
developer to know and use Git and GitHub?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I learned how to program by reading other people’s code
and contributing to open source projects. Submitting a patch and seeing
how the maintainer rewrites it is invaluable: it’s like getting free,
personalized programming lessons from someone with more experience than
you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub is important because it’s one of the best places to participate
in active open source development. The barrier to entry is extremely
low, and with casual forking it’s basically designed for the “make small
changes to a foreign project and see what happens” workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Why GitHub? Why not SourceForge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; SourceForge is about publishing projects, GitHub is about
collaborating on code. SourceForge is helpful when exploring or working
on projects, but this is really where GitHub shines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What were the challenges of putting GitHub together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We’re still facing them today. We not only have to worry
about the database when growing, but also Git repositories on disk – we
essentially have two different data stores, one of which has never been
used at this scale before. We’re constantly doing lots of very cool
caching things under the hood to try and make everything faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big database tables and high IO are our biggest issues. I think the key
is to recognize problems early on and not be afraid of throwing out
existing code in order to implement a better solution. It’s okay to do
things the simple way early on – probably better, really – but you need
to understand that they’re only going to take you so far before you need
to spend more time coming up with a smarter solution that works for
higher load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any suggestions for RubyLearning’s Git &amp;amp;
GitHub course participants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Create and share open source – whether on GitHub or
elsewhere! It’s very rewarding, a great way to meet people, and the best
way to improve your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Chris for sharing your views with the RubyLearning
GitHub course participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\
&lt;em&gt;The opinions expressed are those of Chris Wanstrath and do not
necessarily reflect those of
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/&#34;&gt;www.RubyLearning.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance Ceremony?</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/01/27/will-rubylearning-be-present-at-the-shorty-awards-acceptance-ceremony/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/01/27/will-rubylearning-be-present-at-the-shorty-awards-acceptance-ceremony/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The votes have been cast and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt; have come to an end. The official
results are in, and RubyLearning is a winner of the Shorty Award in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;education category&lt;/a&gt;.
RubyLearning represented by its nearly 7000 participants from over 140
countries are delighted and so am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/satransparent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Winner in Education category at Shorty
Awards&#34; title=&#34;Winner in the Education category at Shorty Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt;, they have been given to “the best
producers of short content in 2008.” And by short content, they mean 140
characters or less. In other words, these are the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/rubylearning&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Rubylearning get as a Shorty Award winner? Aside from &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt;,
apparently a \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/awards-ceremony/&#34;&gt;awards
ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. The award
ceremony will be streamed online, posted to YouTube, and photographed /
videotaped by various media outlets. Additionally, 3 favorite Shorty
Awards nominations or votes tweeted by RubyLearning’s followers will be
projected onto a screen behind me when I (representing RubyLearning)
appear on stage to give a 140 character acceptance speech. In addition,
RubyLearning will receive an awards plaque and a gift bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though RubyLearning won, it only received 275 official votes, and I (for
RubyLearning) shamelessly asked my 1000 or so Twitter followers and 7000
RubyLearning participants to vote for me on several occasions. Only 3.4%
of my own followers thought RubyLearning deserved to win or made the
effort to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McAWilliams in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://verba.mcawilliams.com/archive/the-shorty-awards-final.html&#34;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
says that “*I think the idea of the awards themselves is an excellent
idea but the system has a few flaws*“. I agree. He mentions these flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voting system should not be based on just being a popularity
contest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly people nominate tweeters in what ever category they feel
they should be in – Rubylearning was also nominated in “humor”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of pre-populated tweets where you can provide a simple url
that brings you to your twitter webpage and has a tweet pre-filled
for you, is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance
Ceremony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to be there but some of the reasons I won’t, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn, New York does not cover my
US\$ 1750 (roughly) cost of traveling to New York from Pune, India
where I reside. Shorty Awards probably did not realize that someone
from outside of USA could win in one of their 26 official
categories! &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that “*some
winners from Russia and Australia are attending the award
ceremony*“. I wonder who these twitterers are?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorty Awards gave the winners only 14 days to make their travel
arrangements. The time is too short for international winners, like
me. All the tickets from Mumbai to New York on most airlines are
already booked. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that
“&lt;em&gt;this is the award’s first year, and there are bound to be hiccups.
We’ll take this situation into account for next year, and try to
give winners more time to make travel arrangements to the
ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lighter vein, it’s freezing out there in New York. Pune is a
comfortable 86^o^ F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Shorty Awards should seriously consider is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s giving out \$1,000 travel grants so that winners (the actual
people Twittering) can attend the event, so it can only be used by
winners who actually attend. (Not by proxies or winners who don’t
attend). &lt;strong&gt;This is incorrect. All award ceremonies allow proxies to
collect an award for a winner, in case the winner can’t attend – why
not at Shorty Awards? Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards clarified that “*the
\$1000 is not an ‘award’, it is a ‘travel grant’, and therefore can
only be claimed by winners traveling to the ceremony.*“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a winner can’t be present at the awards ceremony, Shorty Awards
should courier the winners’ awards plaque and gift bag. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
Shorty Awards clarified that “&lt;em&gt;they would mail the award plaque if a
winner could not make it to the awards ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/shorty.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shorty
Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, RubyLearning’s follower count increased dramatically
and many of these people have started to converse with me regularly and
I know will become good net friends! So many new ideas got discussed and
all of this is good for &lt;strong&gt;Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. Even at this late stage, some of my
RubyLearning participants want to start a donation drive to collect
funds so that I can travel to New York – very sweet of them. Friends,
why collect and waste money on my trip to New York. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/415&#34;&gt;do
donate and collect money for
RubyLearning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that I can
continue maintaining the RubyLearning sites and provide quality content
to you. Game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you all so much for voting for RubyLearning. Almost all of
your 140 character ballots expressing why RubyLearning deserved to win
the award were terrific. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@DrGreene: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because he makes learning programming fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@TinaShang: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because…Knowledge is power and he is giving it away
free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@hectorsq: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it really helps to spread Ruby all around the world,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@mjuneja: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it makes Ruby learning fun &amp;amp; easy &amp;amp; makes famous Rubyists
accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@Melindhra: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because it’s the best online learning community I’ve
seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Speech&lt;/strong&gt;: RubyLearning sent a video of its acceptance
speech to Shorty Awards for the 11th Feb. award ceremony in New York.
(Unfortunately, no longer available.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
    New Course Offerings
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;update&#34;&gt;
    We&amp;#8217;re rapidly expanding our course offerings here at RubyLearning, trying to keep up with the enormous and ever-growing interest in &lt;strong&gt;Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. But we need your &lt;b&gt;YOUR&lt;/b&gt; help because, as you know, Ruby is a big subject, and we&amp;#8217;d like to be sure to focus in on the areas of most interest to &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A Note regarding the courses mentioned in the poll below&lt;/strong&gt;:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Ruby Testing and TDD&lt;/strong&gt;: (starting from the concepts of testing in general, Test::Unit and other tools are discussed. RSpec is not discussed. Suited for people trying to code test code.)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Ruby GUI&lt;/strong&gt;: (GUI programming. Which library do you recommend &amp;#8211; Shoes, FXRuby?)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Ruby: Git and GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: (A short course where you study Git and GitHub. Basic operations are discussed. Publishing a gem using GitHub.)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Ruby &amp; SQLite3 database&lt;/strong&gt;: (Learn SQLite3 using Ruby. Beneficial for those who already know another database and for those are relatively new to database itself.)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;JRuby&lt;/strong&gt;: This course is already available, but wanted to check whether you want it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Merb&lt;/strong&gt;: This is becoming very popular in the community.
    &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;h3&gt;
    A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;update&#34;&gt;
    Welcome to the next installment of the weekly interview series on the &lt;abbr title=&#34;RubyLearning&#34;&gt;RL&lt;/abbr&gt; blog &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Path to Ruby Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; by top trainers and developers in the &lt;strong&gt;Ruby community&lt;/strong&gt;, from across the globe. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Ruby trainers and developers, with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions &lt;strong&gt;Ruby beginners&lt;/strong&gt; face. We welcome your suggestions for interviewees and questions. Look for a new post every Tuesday!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/stuart_halloway.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stuart Halloway, USA&#34; title=&#34;Stuart Halloway, USA&#34; width=&#34;125&#34; height=&#34;163&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;his week, we&amp;#8217;re happy to have &lt;strong&gt;Stuart Halloway&lt;/strong&gt; from USA.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome, Stuart and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I am Stuart Halloway. Along with Justin Gehtland I founded &lt;a href=&#34;http://thinkrelevance.com/&#34;&gt;Relevance, Inc&lt;/a&gt;. We specialize in development, consulting and training using agile methodologies and low-ceremony tools such as Ruby.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I wrote Component Development for the Java Platform, Rails for Java Developers (with Justin), and am currently working on a book about Clojure.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to learn the Ruby language is to explore it. irb is a great interactive shell for trying things out. I would also recommend *learning tests*. Mike Clark and I independently learned Ruby this way, and he blogged about it &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/03/18&#34;&gt;Ruby Learning Test #1: Are You There, World?&lt;/a&gt;. Of course the libraries have changed &amp;#8211; now you probably would want to do &amp;#8220;learning RSpecs&amp;#8221;!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Anning, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby, including different frameworks, gems and external libraries?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely look at the different testing/BDD frameworks: RSpec, dust, Shoulda, etc. Looking at how different Ruby people approach the same problem domain is a great way to learn.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Make sure to learn other languages too. I have been spending a lot of time with &lt;a href=&#34;http://clojure.org/&#34;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; and it is terrific.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most beginners in Ruby, would like to contribute their time, skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Could you suggest some?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you are doing Rails, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://opensource.thinkrelevance.com/wiki/tarantula&#34;&gt;Tarantula&lt;/a&gt;. Tarantula spiders your app, looking for all kinds of possible issues. The basic framework is in place, but there are tons of possible plugins to write.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The various Ruby VMs (IronRuby/JRuby/Rubinius) are great: They are technically interesting and there is always plenty to do. You don&amp;#8217;t have to be a guru &amp;#8211; there are tons of basic documentation and testing work to be done, and they can help you learn more about the internals of the language.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Brady, Australia&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What types of applications are currently being developed in Ruby and what changes do you foresee over the next year or two?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously there are many Rails applications out there, and not just for public web applications. A lot of intranet IT work is being done in Rails as well.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Over the next few years expect to see a lot more penetration of Ruby itself, including some significant desktop applications.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Goff, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The most visible work is certainly web, but there are other things out there as well, especially with the viability of JRuby in the Java world.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    There is a great need for sysadmins with Ruby skills. Best practices for Rails deployment seem to change several times a year, so it is exciting to keep pace.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What can / should job candidates (for Ruby) do to distinguish themselves from their competition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The candidate has done his/her homework on the company that they are interviewing with. The candidate understands what they&amp;#8217;re looking for, and the candidate is prepared to show them that he/she fits the bill, based on the candidate&amp;#8217;s skills and experience. What else can the candidate do, to set themselves apart from other equally well-qualified and well-prepared candidates?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFCC;&#34;&gt;Make your name in open source. If I can find your code on the web, that&amp;#8217;s big. If I can find a *community* that you have built around an open source project, even bigger.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any other suggestions for these participants (would-be Ruby developers)?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Stuart&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Get involved in the community. Join your local Ruby group. Attend conferences. Software development is social *and becoming more so*. The best way to learn new things and maintain a high energy level is to share your passion for Ruby with others.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Stuart for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3&gt;
    A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;update&#34;&gt;
    Welcome to the next installment of the weekly interview series on the &lt;abbr title=&#34;RubyLearning&#34;&gt;RL&lt;/abbr&gt; blog &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Path to Ruby Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; by top trainers and developers in the &lt;strong&gt;Ruby community&lt;/strong&gt;, from across the globe. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Ruby trainers and developers, with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions &lt;strong&gt;Ruby beginners&lt;/strong&gt; face. We welcome your suggestions for interviewees and questions. Look for a new post every Tuesday!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/drnic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dr Nic Williams, Australia&#34; title=&#34;Dr Nic Williams, Australia&#34; width=&#34;125&#34; height=&#34;125&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;his week, we&amp;#8217;re proud to have &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic Williams&lt;/strong&gt; from Australia.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome, Dr Nic and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In a frenzy of excitement, I released my first three open source projects in mid-2006 for the Ruby community: Dr Nic&amp;#8217;s Magic Models, Composite Primary Keys for Active Record, and the New Gem Generator (newgem). Fortunately people started reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://drnicwilliams.com/&#34;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; and then I wanted to write more projects. In the last two years I&amp;#8217;ve released a bunch of fun and moderately useful projects for Ruby, JavaScript and Objective-C.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    My life before Ruby (2005 and before) involved C# and Java professionally, and Smalltalk and Python during my years of academia. I like using Ruby as much for the community as for the language itself. My favorite hacker activity is scraping data from websites.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I now run the premier iPhone/Rails consultancy, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mocra.com/&#34;&gt;Mocra&lt;/a&gt;. I still hack open source code when no one else is watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My full name is Nicholas Peter Williams, and I have a PhD at the University of Queensland, so I can call myself Dr Nic with a straight face of hard-earned authority. My mother still just calls me Nicholas, and my wife calls me many things. My 2 year old eldest son calls me Daddy, and my youngest 4 mth old daughter just sucks my fingers and arms whenever she can get hold of them!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Find a web app or project you want to do and write it. Do it with or with out tests, with or without plugins/gems, with or without any knowledge of what you are doing. Solve each problem as you go by reading blogs, using existing plugins/gems, asking questions on mailing lists and irc. And then start another project and another project. I guess you learn something by discovering as many things that you don&amp;#8217;t know as possible and then learning them. For software development that means just write more code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What has been your biggest challenge while working with Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of the libraries/gems/plugins you&amp;#8217;d like to use are probably &amp;#8220;beta&amp;#8221; quality or don&amp;#8217;t exist. To full embrace Ruby is to embrace the need to nurture and improve these 3rd party libraries and fix them as well as write your own code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Anning, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What best practices are most important for a new Ruby programmer to learn and understand?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Test Driven Development&lt;/strong&gt;. This wonderful practise is almost forced upon by the lack of helpful tools like compilation. There is no &amp;#8220;pre-execution&amp;#8221; tool chain to warn you or stop you running dodgy code. Without unit tests thru to end-to-end tests you have no way to know that that last small change to your model to fix one problem also broken three other portions of your application. A life without TDD/BDD is an unhappy life. But even better, a life guided by the principles, processes and tools for TDD/BDD make for a great life for a developer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most beginners in Ruby, would like to contribute their time, skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Could you suggest some?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Is it silly to guesstimate that the biggest hurdle to people contributing to OSS projects or creating new OSS projects is low estimation of self-worth? It&amp;#8217;s a theory. If it&amp;#8217;s true then I think the following is a useful metaphor for open source software projects:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Think of existing OSS projects as clubhouses: initially each project only has one lonely developer. They definitely want people to join their clubhouse. They&amp;#8217;ll be more than helpful to show you how to join the clubhouse, and probably quickly give you the keys to the door so you can help yourself. They&amp;#8217;ll show you how to use SVN or Git, how to make changes, how to run the tests, how to fix bugs, and how to prepare patches or push new git forks.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;And because it&amp;#8217;s a clubhouse you can do crazy things: start an IRC channel, create a wiki, organise a dedicated website, get t-shirts, design &amp;#8220;I use XYZ&amp;#8221; badges for blogs and write blog articles about the project, how to use it, why its cool, why you like it more than similar projects etc. Make your clubhouse bigger.&lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Humans like to pick teams and start fights. DHH had victory with Rails with this process, I think. (Starting a fight doesn&amp;#8217;t mean being rude or offensive).&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Goff, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Professionally, at some point though there will be the need to use a wide variety of technologies, languages and frameworks to meet client/real-world requirements. Nonetheless, it is your responsibility as a professional software professional to recommend and ultimately demand that you use the best tools for the job. If that tool, for one or more tasks, is Ruby then so be it. If your boss, or future employers, disagree with you on your selections of technologies for specific tasks then remember one thing:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;You only need one job/employer at a time. Surely you can find or train one to care like you care about appropriate tools and technologies. Teach your boss to care about you as a human and then reward them with outrageous displays of awesomeness.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      We try to script every sys admin job in Ruby. We&amp;#8217;ve started working on a &amp;#8220;New computer (OS X) installer&amp;#8221; script called &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/bjeanes/noober/tree/master&#34;&gt;Noober&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;ll be like a capistrano/deprec set of recipes for installing our favourite apps, bookmarks, preferences, rubygems, etc on new OS X machines. Very awesome; not finished, but awesome. I use Ruby to write unit tests for Objective-C libraries and I&amp;#8217;ve heard of Java projects using RSpec + JRuby for testing. I use Ruby to scrape the data usage from my 3G and ADSL carriers&amp;#8217; websites. I use Ruby to script TextMate via its bundles mechanism.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      My attitude to life is &amp;#8220;how can I make sure I want to do this job for the next 40 years?&amp;#8221; Massaging Ruby into as many aspects of my life as possible is a part of my personal answer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What can / should job candidates (for Ruby) do to distinguish themselves from their competition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The candidate has done his/her homework on the company that they are interviewing with. The candidate understands what they&amp;#8217;re looking for, and the candidate is prepared to show them that he/she fits the bill, based on the candidate&amp;#8217;s skills and experience. What else can the candidate do, to set themselves apart from other equally well-qualified and well-prepared candidates?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As an employer I have a &amp;#8220;wow!&amp;#8221; template I subconsciously apply to any developers I meet that includes: addicted to open source and/or personal coding projects; is already an expert at something (hopefully Ruby, but Ruby is easy to learn); isn&amp;#8217;t in love with their current job; and would get on well with other developers and empower each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Assuming all these things were equal in a potential new person I&amp;#8217;d probably pick the person based on: enthusiasm for life; enthusiasm for our craft; williness to tell me and others that we are wrong and give passionate logical reasons why; and participation at local dev groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      If I were a candidate for a job or for a client project I would measure my progress in getting the job/project with the simple but penetrating question: I can start on the 5th of October or the 12th of October, which is best? Chops and sausages. Don&amp;#8217;t ask kids what they want for dinner, just ask them if they want either chops or sausages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any other suggestions for these participants (would-be Ruby developers)?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Dr Nic&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; To learn and fall in love with Ruby:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        write a web scraper using Hpricot and/or Mechanize
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        wrap it in a RubyGem (using newgem or hoe/sow or bones etc)
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        make it a command-line executable (bin/xyz) that runs the web scraper and dumps results to STDOUT
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        deploy RubyGem to RubyForge
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        tell your friends to install it: gem install xyz
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        write another RubyGem that uses the output of your first gem as its STDIN input
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        pipe the apps together: xyz | abc | mno
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Holy moly it is awesome fun.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Dr Nic for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;his week, we are happy to have &lt;strong&gt;James Edward Gray II&lt;/strong&gt; from USA.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome, James and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; My name is James Edward Gray II and I&amp;#8217;ve been trapped in the Ruby community for almost five years now. I keep trying to get out, but this place is just so much fun I can&amp;#8217;t seem to break away.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;ve tried to give back some contributions for everything Ruby has given me. I started the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyquiz.com/&#34;&gt;Ruby Quiz&lt;/a&gt; and ran it for the first three years, I wrote documentation for some standard libraries including ERb and PStore. I created some open source libraries including &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyforge.org/projects/fastercsv/&#34;&gt;FasterCSV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://highline.rubyforge.org/&#34;&gt;HighLine&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pragprog.com/search?q=James+Edward+Gray+II&#34;&gt;Pragmatic Programmer books&lt;/a&gt; with lots of Ruby in them. I speak at some Ruby conferences, and I now help maintain a few of Ruby&amp;#8217;s standard libraries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    My day job is building Rails applications for &lt;a href=&#34;http://highgroove.com/&#34;&gt;Highgroove Studios&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Books, tutorials, and similar reference materials are wonderful and very needed. However, I truly believe there is only one way to learn a programming language: write 500 programs in it. Obviously I just made that number up, but the point is the same. You learn to code by writing code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Programming is about learning to think like a computer. The languages are very small compared to those we speak, so that&amp;#8217;s not the challenge. The challenge is learning to think like a very dumb machine. To do that, you need to have a lot of conversations with the machine. You have to learn how it thinks and give it a chance to dumb you down. That means feeding it code and learning to interpret those cryptic error messages.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Given that, my number one recommendation for those learning would be to get a pet project and dive right in. Choose something you are interested in or just a simple project that could save you some time with work. Read reference materials as you go to learn the part you are working on now. Ask questions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/&#34;&gt;Ruby-Talk&lt;/a&gt; when you get stuck. &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFCC;&#34;&gt;The most important thing though is to keep writing code. That&amp;#8217;s how you learn. Believe it.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Brady, Australia&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What are the pros and cons of Ruby that are being discussed in the development community and what is your opinion on that?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#8217;ll hear a lot of people say, &amp;#8220;Ruby is slow.&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That can be true, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be. I just gave a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lsrc2008.confreaks.com/02-james-edward-gray-ii-hidden-gems.html&#34;&gt;LSRC&lt;/a&gt; that showed multiple ways to get Ruby to do work in fractions of a second.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    My opinion on the speed rumors is that you shouldn&amp;#8217;t believe everything you hear. I&amp;#8217;m sure there are tasks Ruby is too slow for, but there are also a surprising number of tasks where you can make it go fast enough.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What has been your biggest challenge while working with Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I am in the middle of replacing Ruby&amp;#8217;s old CSV library with my FasterCSV code base. Part of that process includes reworking the parser to work well with 1.9&amp;#8217;s &lt;abbr title=&#34;multilingualization&#34;&gt;m17n&lt;/abbr&gt; implementation. That has been pretty tough.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Part of that is because Ruby&amp;#8217;s m17n code is new and still has some minor oddities. That&amp;#8217;s improving all the time though as we find bugs. The bigger issue is just that character encodings are hard to get right, especially when working with non-ASCII compatible encodings like UTF-16.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In a way, you can argue it is a testament to the new m17n implementation that it is making it possible for me to get CSV working with so many popular encodings. I won&amp;#8217;t kid you though, it was hard work.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Anning, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby, including different frameworks, gems and external libraries?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m a huge fan of Ruby&amp;#8217;s standard library. Ruby ships with so many great tools. I can&amp;#8217;t count the number of times I&amp;#8217;ve seen someone working on a tough problem and I showed them how to solve it with a require statement and a line or two of code to make use of a standard library.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Plenty of these libraries are still missing documentation too, so it&amp;#8217;s an excellent opportunity to take your first steps into the community. Crack open one of the libraries, put on your code investigation hat, and try to figure out what it is capable of. Call methods in IRb and try passing them different kinds of data. Take notes as you go and you can turn those into documentation to help other programmers. It&amp;#8217;s surprisingly fun.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most beginners in Ruby, would like to contribute their time, skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Could you suggest some?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I asked this exact question at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lsrc2008.confreaks.com/18-panel-ruby-designers-producers-and-consumers.html&#34;&gt;LSRC panel&lt;/a&gt; with many smart Rubyists including Matz and Dave Thomas. Their answer: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFCC;&#34;&gt;be passionate about what you do&lt;/span&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s great advice.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The biggest thing I can suggest is to get involved today. There are ways you can help no matter what your skill level is. I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned a documentation tip, but there are plenty of others. Get involved with some Ruby project that interests you. Join their mailing list and help answer questions there. Offer to build a web site for the project if they don&amp;#8217;t have one. Or just install the test release of Ruby 1.9, play around a bit, and write blogs posts about the new features. Don&amp;#8217;t be shy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Remember, helping the community isn&amp;#8217;t just about being generous. You are building your portfolio that a future employer will see as an added bonus.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Goff, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I would definitely say that Ruby is seeing the most use currently in the Web application world. That&amp;#8217;s not all it can do though and some brave souls are pushing those boundaries!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Ruby has begun to make some inroads into the sciences. &lt;acronym title=&#34;[ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ]&#34;&gt;NOAA&lt;/acronym&gt; used Ruby to analyze satellite images of that damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, I spoke with a genetic researcher doing some genome processing with Ruby at the LSRC, and even &lt;acronym title=&#34;[ National Aeronautics and Space Administration ]&#34;&gt;NASA&lt;/acronym&gt; is using Ruby on a few projects now.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That&amp;#8217;s just one field. Ruby is ready for us to take it into many new fields. My hope for the future is that we take Ruby to new places and do for them what we&amp;#8217;ve done for web development.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any other suggestions for these participants (would-be Ruby developers)?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;James&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Be immune to the word &amp;#8220;can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221; There are two kinds of people, those who say they can&amp;#8217;t and those who aren&amp;#8217;t afraid to try. Be one of the latter. Succeed or fail that&amp;#8217;s all it really takes to be a hero.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks James for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
    A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;update&#34;&gt;
    We&amp;#8217;re excited to launch a new interview series on the &lt;abbr title=&#34;RubyLearning&#34;&gt;RL&lt;/abbr&gt; blog &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Path to Ruby Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; by top trainers and developers in the &lt;strong&gt;Ruby community&lt;/strong&gt;, from across the globe. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Ruby trainers and developers, with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions &lt;strong&gt;Ruby beginners&lt;/strong&gt; face. We welcome your suggestions for interviewees and questions. Look for a new post every Tuesday!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/jamiedyke.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jamie van Dyke, UK&#34; title=&#34;Jamie van Dyke, UK&#34; width=&#34;125&#34; height=&#34;129&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;e&amp;#8217;re proud to have &lt;strong&gt;Jamie van Dyke&lt;/strong&gt; from the UK, kick off the series.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome, Jamie and thanks for helping with the inaugural &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Path to Ruby Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; post and for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m Jamie van Dyke. I live near Leeds in the UK, and I&amp;#8217;ve been doing web development since early 1996. I began using Ruby on Rails in January of 2005. Since then I&amp;#8217;ve been a contractor working with a bunch of startups, I did a year and a half as the App Support Manager (EU) for Engine Yard, as well as being part of their Automation team. Now I run Parfait, which is &amp;#8220;The Ruby Agency&amp;#8221; in the UK, we do training, recruitment (in a non-traditional, non-evil way) and consultancy. I run a blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fearoffish.com/&#34;&gt;Fear of Fish&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at &lt;em&gt;Ruby beginners&lt;/em&gt; mostly, it&amp;#8217;s been neglected lately but that is changing.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willian Molinari, Brazil&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I wholeheartedly recommend the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/3qnzkn&#34;&gt;Beginning Ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; book by Peter Cooper&lt;sup class=&#39;footnote&#39;&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#fn-410-1&#39; id=&#39;fnref-410-1&#39;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It covers the basics completely, and then moves on to more advanced topics further on. If you&amp;#8217;re learning Ruby to use Ruby on Rails, then once you&amp;#8217;ve done some reading and playing around, move on to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://railscasts.com/&#34;&gt;RailsCasts&lt;/a&gt; site as well as the impressive &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/08/06/thanks-to-rubylearning-sponsor-peepcode/&#34;&gt;PeepCode screencasts&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;d also highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/3mu2g8&#34;&gt;Design Patterns in Ruby&lt;/a&gt; by Russ Olsen, it shows you the best way to structure the majority of problems you&amp;#8217;ll be faced with. Also, as Rick Olsen has reminded me, &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#8217;s important to pass on that knowledge to others and by doing this you develop yourself more by thinking through what you know, and probably solidify that knowledge to yourself&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Of course, there&amp;#8217;s nothing like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;good training course&lt;/a&gt; either. &lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&#34; alt=&#34;;-)&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Brady, Australia&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What are the pros and cons of Ruby that are being discussed in the development community and what is your opinion on that?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The biggest pro has got to be the readability, for me&lt;/em&gt;. Ruby is such a simple language that you can pick it up quickly and move straight in to how best to use it, rather than studying the language for a great deal of time before being useful. Being simple makes it really quick to code in too, for lack of better words &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;it works like your brain does&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I haven&amp;#8217;t heard any rumbles in the community about Ruby apart from performance issues, which I&amp;#8217;ve never come across as really being an issue. &lt;em&gt;Ruby wasn&amp;#8217;t planned to be a high performance language, it&amp;#8217;s more about the capabilities it has and the benefits that it gives the developer. If I was to gripe about any part of Ruby, it would have to be the meta programming. Yes, the meta programming is a great tool, but it&amp;#8217;s abused by amateurs and pro&amp;#8217;s too much. 80% of the time I see meta programming it&amp;#8217;s unnecessary and merely complicates the application itself. I&amp;#8217;ve always believed Ruby is more about keeping code maintainable through the power of it&amp;#8217;s simplicity, not to show off your prowess by complicating it. So think before you engage the power of the meta!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Anning, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What best practices are most important for a new Ruby programmer to learn and understand?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned the Design Patterns in Ruby book, &lt;em&gt;so step one is to understand the best way to structure your code and to recognise which pattern fits what use&lt;/em&gt;. That will be a big help in not only the speed in which you can develop applications, but also the fact that other developers who are familiar with these patterns (and they&amp;#8217;re not just restricted to Ruby) will be able to pick up your code and get to grips with what you&amp;#8217;re doing, very quickly. On a side note, I&amp;#8217;m also quite particular about naming conventions and coding structure. &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t use CamelCase for method names as they do in Java and others&lt;/em&gt;, more_like_this and lessLikeThis. One is more readable, and that&amp;#8217;s very important to me.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most beginners in Ruby, would like to contribute their time, skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Could you suggest some?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on your skill level there are plenty of good places to start. Ruby on Rails, for the more core parts, is high up on the needed skills list. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of meta-programming wizardry in there to get your head around if you want to contribute to Rails significantly. On the other hand there&amp;#8217;s plenty of smaller pieces you can help with that don&amp;#8217;t take a Ruby guru to help with. So you could say it&amp;#8217;s got the best of both.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Some others you could find on &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and dig into are &lt;a href=&#34;http://merbivore.com/&#34;&gt;Merb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/mojombo/grit/tree/master&#34;&gt;Grit&lt;/a&gt;. Merb is a more agnostic web framework than Rails. Grit is a ruby library for interacting with Git.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Goff, USA&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;#8217;t deny that Rails is going to be a big part of Ruby for quite a while, it was certainly the catalyst for a lot of people to gain an interest. It&amp;#8217;s hard to say what the future will hold, but there&amp;#8217;s definitely a trend to push the uses of the framework to a new level. &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/HomePage&#34;&gt;RubyCocoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/05/31/a-teeny-weeny-mp3-player-using-ruby-and-shoes/&#34;&gt;Shoes&lt;/a&gt; are pushing the boundaries on the GUI development branch of use, and system administration scripting is also something I&amp;#8217;ve seen used quite often myself and have seen others use. It won&amp;#8217;t replace the other languages, of course, but I think it&amp;#8217;s finding a solid place in the ranks of general use languages.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What can / should job candidates (for Ruby) do to distinguish themselves from their competition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The candidate has done his/her homework on the company that they are interviewing with. The candidate understands what they&amp;#8217;re looking for, and the candidate is prepared to show them that he/she fits the bill, based on the candidate&amp;#8217;s skills and experience. What else can the candidate do, to set themselves apart from other equally well-qualified and well-prepared candidates?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What interests me most about Ruby developers that I hire isn&amp;#8217;t their current skill level or expertise. I&amp;#8217;m not interested how clever they can be with their meta-programming-fu, I&amp;#8217;m interested in their use of the language. Yes it&amp;#8217;s nice if a candidate is able to do the most advanced Ruby, and I wouldn&amp;#8217;t disregard a potential developer for using it. However, I&amp;#8217;ve seen far too many developers weaving layers of clever code together merely because they know how.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The most important part of developing for me is maintainability. How well can their code be picked up by other developers? This is high on my importance list. Keep it Simple Stupid (KISS) is one of my practices, so I expect any one I hire to do the same. That&amp;#8217;s not to say that they won&amp;#8217;t need to be able to understand complicated code or be able to fire out some, anyone who wants to pick up Rails and dabble in the source code certainly needs to be fluent in these methods.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    When I hire someone I want to see their code and their attitude towards it. &lt;em&gt;Open Source software is the first place I look to see what they&amp;#8217;ve done&lt;/em&gt;. Contributing to other peoples frameworks shows an ability to understand other developers code, and more importantly, that their contributions were good enough to be accepted. If there are no contributions to other peoples software, they&amp;#8217;ll struggle against others I might have on my list.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any other suggestions for these participants (would-be Ruby developers)?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Jamie&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Only that you should be learning Ruby because they enjoy it, and therefore to have fun. Ruby is here to stay, and working with it is a pleasure for most, so if you&amp;#8217;re not one of those developers it&amp;#8217;s time to pick another language, or profession!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#CC3333;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satish Talim&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Jamie for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here have been some heavy discussions at &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;RubyLearning&lt;/a&gt; about what all should be covered in an &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Ruby Course&lt;/strong&gt;. Many topics have been suggested along with a &amp;#8216;for&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;against&amp;#8217; each topic, but nothing concrete has come out. I&amp;#8217;d like the topics to be more relevant to the &amp;#8216;&lt;em&gt;Real World Ruby&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216; which any programmer with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://book.rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;basic knowledge of Ruby&lt;/a&gt; could master and use. At our Free Core Ruby Programming Course we cover the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html&#34;&gt;following topics&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;You suggest&lt;/strong&gt;: To arrive at this list of 21 topics, I need &lt;strong&gt;YOUR&lt;/strong&gt; help. I&amp;#8217;d like you to suggest the topic(s) and remember to mention why the topic(s) you suggest are important.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The â€˜Rulesâ€™&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Any feedback, suggestions, dreams or ideas that you have are welcome. While I canâ€™t promise to respond to each comment or put every suggestion into place I make a commitment to you to read anything you have to say.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    All that I ask in return is that you be honest, courteous and constructive with your feedback.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    RubyLearning is a project that I pour a lot of time and effort into &amp;#8211; as a result sometimes criticism can be a little difficult to hear &amp;#8211; however I think itâ€™s vital to take it all on board if this is to continue to be a valuable resource for would-be Ruby developers wanting to improve their Ruby skills.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    So itâ€™s over to you. Feel free to either leave your feedback here as comments or to share them privately with me via my email at &lt;strong&gt;mail [at] satishtalim [dot] com&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;YOU can make a difference!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I do have my own list of 21 topics but I have not posted it here, so that I don&amp;#8217;t influence your thinking.
  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TMail: Sending email</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/08/21/tmail-sending-email/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/08/21/tmail-sending-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      TMail is a commonly used library by the ActionMailer component of Ruby
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;drop_cap&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he students of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/class/&#34;&gt;FORPC101&lt;/a&gt; batch wanted to know how they could &lt;strong&gt;send an email in Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. Today, out of the various options available, we will have a quick look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tmail.rubyforge.org/index.html&#34;&gt;TMail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; a library used for composing and manipulating email messages for Ruby.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMail&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to be an Request For Comments (RFC) compatible library. The goal of TMail is to allow you to create emails programatically without having to know about the RFCs or how they work, or what their standards are&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Installation
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    On a Windows box, we can install the TMail gem as follows:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;c:\&gt;gem install tmail&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Sending an email
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You first put at the top of your class:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &#39;tmail&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Accessing a TMail object is done via the &lt;strong&gt;TMail::Mail&lt;/strong&gt; class. As email can be fairly complex creatures, you will find a large amount of accessor and setter methods in this class!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You then create an empty mail object by calling &lt;strong&gt;TMail::Mail.new&lt;/strong&gt;. This creates a completely blank email message. To be a valid email message, you&amp;#8217;ll need to modify the headers by simply accessing them using the accessor methods. Some of the public instance methods we use are: from, to, subject, date and body (for full details, please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tmail.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html&#34;&gt;TMail documentation&lt;/a&gt;). For example, the documentation for the instance method subject is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subject( default = nil )&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns the subject of the mail instance. If the subject field does not exist, returns nil by default or you can pass in as the parameter for what you want the default value to be. Example:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mail = TMail::Mail.new
mail.subject #=&gt; nil
mail.subject(&#34;&#34;) #=&gt; &#34;&#34;
mail.subject = &#34;Hello&#34;
mail.subject #=&gt; &#34;Hello&#34;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Once the email message is created, you can call the to_s method to convert it back into a string. Then it can be sent with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/smtp/rdoc/index.html&#34;&gt;Net::SMTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; library. The Net::SMTP library provides functionality to send internet mail via SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. The Net::SMTP.start method creates a new Net::SMTP object, opens a TCP connection and connects to the server. &amp;#8216;localhost&amp;#8217; is the IP address of your SMTP server and the port used is 25. Since we have called with a block, the newly-opened Net::SMTP object is yielded to the block, and automatically closed when the block finishes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Before you run the program (full code below), you need to start the SMTP server. On Windows, I prefer to download and use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.softstack.com/freesmtp.html&#34;&gt;Free SMTP Server&lt;/a&gt; for testing. Connect your PC to the Internet, then start the Free SMTP Server program. The program will try to detect your provider&amp;#8217;s DNS server. If a DNS server is available and the standard SMTP port #25 is free, the program will become ready to process your mail. If it is not possible to detect provider&amp;#8217;s DNS server, the program will prompt you to enter any DNS server you know, after that if the server exists the program will become ready to process mail. If the port #25 is busy by another local SMTP server/service, the program will show you an error message. You can specify any DNS server or SMTP port by using the button Options, which is situated on the Toolbar. You should use the word &amp;#8220;localhost&amp;#8221; as the SMTP server host in your mail program.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Here&amp;#8217;s the complete program code:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;tmail&#39;
require &#39;net/smtp&#39;

tomail = &#39;satishtalim@gmail.com&#39;
frommail = &#39;superman@world.com&#39;
mail = TMail::Mail.new
mail.to = tomail
mail.from = frommail
mail.subject = &#39;Test message&#39;
mail.date = Time.now
mail.body = &#39;Thanks to Locaweb for making this possible.&#39;


Net::SMTP.start( &#39;localhost&#39;, 25 ) do|smtpclient|
  smtpclient.send_message(
    mail.to_s,
    frommail,
    tomail
  )
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It is to be noted that TMail is a commonly used library by the ActionMailer component of Ruby on Rails, the Nitro web framework, the Ruby-Talk mail gateway and many others.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>&#34;AkitaOnRails&#34; Advises A Young Ruby Beginner</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;block&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; title=&#34;Fabio Akita&#34; src=&#34;http://www.rubylearning.com/images/akita.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fabio Akita&#34; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabio Akita&lt;/strong&gt; is a Brazilian Rails enthusiast, also known online as &amp;#8220;AkitaOnRails&amp;#8221;. He regularly write posts on his own &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.akitaonrails.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and had published the very first book tailored for the Brazilian audience called &amp;#8220;Repensando a Web com Rails&amp;#8221;. He is now a full-time Ruby on Rails developer working as Brazil Rails Practice Manager for the Utah company Surgeworks LLC.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;block&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; title=&#34;Paresh Mathur&#34; src=&#34;http://www.rubylearning.com/images/paresh.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Paresh Mathur&#34; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paresh Mathur&lt;/strong&gt; aka &amp;#8220;Rick&amp;#8221;, is a 16 year young participant &amp;#8211; ceek (cool geek) &amp;#8211; at the &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;Free Online Ruby Programming Course&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;. &amp;#8216;Rick&amp;#8217; is a student in XII grade at the Kendriya Vidyalaya Cantonment School in Ahmedabad, India. He&amp;#8217;s an open source fan, loves programming and is very active in the course forums. If not studying, Paresh is tinkering on his computer and helping out friends.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Paresh felt that a pro like Fabio should write an article on what one should do after the &amp;#8216;Free Online Ruby Programming Course&amp;#8217;. He was not aware whether such an article existed and if it did, it would be of great help to him.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Paresh had two questions for Fabio and Fabio was kind enough to answer and also give his invaluable advice.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paresh&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Further Studies&lt;/strong&gt;: What to do next? Can you recommend things to study after the course, including different frameworks and external libraries? If a free course like Satish&amp;#8217;s is in your mind please do share.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Fabio&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The question is very broad in nature, so I can&amp;#8217;t pinpoint a direct answer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Satish has an excellent free online Ruby course at &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;rubylearning.org&lt;/a&gt;. Satish&amp;#8217;s approach should be replicated more, that&amp;#8217;s for sure, and he is doing a great contribution to the community. So, no, I don&amp;#8217;t know by heart any other online free course comparable to Satish&amp;#8217;s. That said, there are a number of good online resources. One that should be on anyone&amp;#8217;s RSS reader is Ryan Bates&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://railscasts.com/&#34;&gt;Railscasts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, where he publishes several small screencasts with tips and best practices using Rails. The other great resource is &lt;a href=&#34;http://peepcode.com/&#34;&gt;Peepcode&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; series of screencasts. Those are not free but are much more elaborate and complete.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I think these are the &amp;#8216;usual suspects&amp;#8217;. But there is so much more. And on the other hand you have to ask yourself &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;at what level am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Most screencasts, tutorials, articles on the internet assume that you&amp;#8217;re at least a reasonably educated programmer. By that I mean, you:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      have a very good understanding on &lt;a href=&#34;http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/algorithms-web.html&#34;&gt;Algorithms and Data Structure&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      have a reasonable understanding on the several different kinds of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language&#34;&gt;programming language styles.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      understand the underpinnings of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Input&#34;&gt;computers&lt;/a&gt;. Basic concepts like I/O.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      you understand, at least, how to deal with structured data in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Relational_model%20databases&#34;&gt;RDBMS-based databases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&#34;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt; should not be a problem to you.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      understand that object-oriented programming is a good thing but it is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented#Criticism&#34;&gt;neither&lt;/a&gt; the only solution nor the best one for all cases.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      understand &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system#Unix_and_Unix-like_operating_systems&#34;&gt;operating systems&lt;/a&gt; well enough and therefore Linux doesn&amp;#8217;t scare you without GUI tools.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      know &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.googleguide.com/&#34;&gt;how to use Google&lt;/a&gt; (and this is not a joke, many people don&amp;#8217;t!)
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The field of Computer Science is very very broad; it is an enormous and ever growing body of knowledge and it is impossible to know everything. That&amp;#8217;s why it is so important to at least focus on the foundations, so you can build your way up on your own. The best programmers learn by themselves the required skills for our craft. Programming is basically a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/SoftwareCraftsmanship/&#34;&gt;craftsmanship&lt;/a&gt;. The same way no one can teach you how to become a Leonardo Da Vinci; it is obviously difficult to come up with a recipe to become the next &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming&#34;&gt;Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That said, you don&amp;#8217;t and you shouldn&amp;#8217;t try to learn every single bullet point, I mentioned above, in deep detail. Remember: I said it is impossible to know the whole. Each bullet point above is a vast and complex body of knowledge by itself. Don&amp;#8217;t try to learn every bit at once, it is time consuming and not valuable.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Instead, educate yourself to at least get to know the basics on each. You don&amp;#8217;t have to become Linus Torvalds to be able to understand the basics on operating systems. Install any Linux distro, read the several tutorials, try to do something useful with it. Then try to solve problems, tweak it, try to make it do different things than what was offered to you out-of-the-box. Try to make it crash and understand why it does so. Trying and error is the best learning process if you are a beginner.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    There is absolutely no set of a fixed number of items that can be listed for you to learn, so you can consider yourself a &lt;strong&gt;good programmer&lt;/strong&gt;. Programming is an art that requires commitment and gives you nothing back: meaning that it never ends. Techniques get obsolete fast, new techniques arise all the time and it is your job, as a programmer, to get to know them.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Read good books, but never consider them absolute truths. Many books have a lot of mistakes and things that can be misinterpreted. Like the classic &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_%28software%29&#34;&gt;Gang of Four&lt;/a&gt; book: it is more of a guideline than a defined set of authoritative techniques that you must use all the time. Different people make different implementations of the same design pattern.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Considering that you already know all this and I am wasting my time &lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#34; alt=&#34;:-)&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; /&gt; Let&amp;#8217;s get straight to the Ruby specific topic: you are already an experienced programmer and you just got initial knowledge about Ruby&amp;#8217;s way. What to do next?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Find yourself an &lt;a href=&#34;http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/&#34;&gt;itch to scratch&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning: find yourself a computer problem for which you may not have a good answer, just yet. You want some new desktop client to better manage your Twitter activities. You want something to hold together all passwords from all your dozen or so social network accounts. Choose whatever you want. It can even be something that already exists but that you think you could do better.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It shouldn&amp;#8217;t be something too big &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;I want to write the next MySpace in Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Less ambition. You&amp;#8217;re just getting started. Type in your first &amp;#8220;Hello World&amp;#8221;, see it running and set the stage for more code to come.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Once you do that, you will probably find yourself either doing a lot of code for something that was supposed to be simple, by Ruby standards, and chances are that you are reinventing the wheel. Define the specific problem you are coding right now and research to see if an alternative library doesn&amp;#8217;t exist already. Or you will try to code something and get stuck at some problem you don&amp;#8217;t even know how to start (&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;how do I authenticate into a Twitter account?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In all cases you have several answers: Google for general research. IRC channels. Google Groups discussion lists. Web-based forums. The Blogosphere. Suit yourself, there is a ton of information available for just about any kind of computer problem. If you are having trouble, chances are someone else has already solved it and was kind enough to document and make it available online. It is just a matter of spending a few minutes researching for it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Without a small problem to solve, you won&amp;#8217;t be able to warm yourself up quick enough. Reading books is fine, but kind of pointless without real usage. Experience is the best way to learn something. You can read hundreds of books on how to ride a bicycle, but you won&amp;#8217;t learn it until you actually try the real thing and fall down for the first time. Only then you start to appreciate the learning process.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paresh&gt;&gt; Hands on&lt;/strong&gt;: Most people, like me, would like to contribute our time, skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so. Fabio, could you suggest some?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Fabio&gt;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is another thing that has no real answer. Being very arrogant the short answer is: &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;if you don&amp;#8217;t know how to contribute, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be thinking about it just yet&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Let me reason why is that: contributing to an open source software is far more complex than writing half a dozen lines of code, submitting it and expecting that it will be used. The process is a lot more complex than that.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Understand that open source projects are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/&#34;&gt;community-driven&lt;/a&gt;. It means that first of all you should start becoming part of a community. It also assumes that you already know of some project you want to participate in. For that, you can&amp;#8217;t be an internet illiterate.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    One project that you know about is Ruby. Fine, you can start by joining the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-forum.com/&#34;&gt;Ruby Core Group&lt;/a&gt;. You can start by downloading Ruby&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; (which is in C, mind you). You will quickly find out that each open source group has a lot going on: bug fixes, feature request, politics. Yes, even politics. You have to be nice to your neighbors in order to gain respect. Simply shouting &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;I want my code in!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; will lead you no-where.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You don&amp;#8217;t contribute for recognition, you contribute because you think some project is valuable to you and, once you get experience and knowledge about its inner gears and general community culture, you think you are able to help in some way: fixing bugs, completing documentation, answering other newbie questions at the forums, giving in new ideas. It is the same thing as joining any social group in real life: don&amp;#8217;t think that just because you&amp;#8217;re in everybody has to pay attention on you. Worse: don&amp;#8217;t even think that your solution is better than anyone else. Chances are that your requests are not new, they were already discussed and decisions were already made. Read the CHANGELOGs, read the discussion lists archives. It is very annoying when newbies sign in and start asking random request that are already buried.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Also, make sure you understand the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html&#34;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; around open source software. It is not as trivial as one could think. Understand open source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_license&#34;&gt;Licenses&lt;/a&gt;. Chances are, if you are a beginner, that you never read any of those documents. All of them being published in the open, it is not an excuse to not know all of them.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Again, let&amp;#8217;s assume that you already are a programmer well aware of all the culture and what&amp;#8217;s going on around open source projects. You just want to know how to contribute to the Ruby community.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Ruby 1.8 is in maintenance mode. There are bugs to be fixed, documentation to be completed. Join the Ruby list and see what they are discussing.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/&#34;&gt;Ruby on Windows&lt;/a&gt; needs some love. Luis Lavena would love to have more help on testing, debugging, Windows internal specifics (if you are a Windows system specialist), documentation, packaging, distribution and so on.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Maybe you are a web developer and you learned Ruby because of Rails. So show Rails some love and start digging through Rails &lt;a href=&#34;http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/&#34;&gt;bug list&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the discussions and read what people are already doing.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyforge.org/top/mostactive.php?type=week&#34;&gt;RubyForge&lt;/a&gt; is one of the main sources of Ruby projects. Check it out for projects that you like and join their communities.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/popular/forked&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is the new kid on the block but it is already hosting several high profile projects. Bear in mind that popular projects means lots of people to deal with, you don&amp;#8217;t want to attract attention without need.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You did realize that the first step for contributing to any open source project is to join their communities, right? It is not enough to download the source code, change a few bits and expect it to show up in the official repository. Open source means commitment to a community. It is totally driven by mutual respect, open discussions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you are a beginner it is good enough to just join the community and follow what&amp;#8217;s going on, passively, until you get a grip on how things work and start posting questions and asking directions. This is socializing-101. There actually is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inet.bg/faq/netiquete.html&#34;&gt;Netiquete&lt;/a&gt; that you really should follow.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As I said before, look for an &amp;#8216;itch to scratch&amp;#8217;. No one wakes up one day and decides &amp;#8216;I will help some project&amp;#8217;. It is not how it works. The more usual use case is that you&amp;#8217;re using something from somebody else and you get yourself stuck with it. &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;It may be a bug!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; But it may not! First thing: you Google over it. You research the discussion forums and mailing lists. You research the bug tracker site (if the project has one). Then, after a lot of researching you realized that it is an undocumented bug. Second step, you make sure it is a bug and are not using the product in the wrong way. You build tests. You debug it. You think twice.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Once you have done all that and know it is a bug, you go to step three and see if it is something you think you&amp;#8217;re able to fix. Either way, you ask the community about it, if no one knows anything about it, you file in a bug ticket. Now you can wait for a fix or, if you really want to contribute, you post all details about the bug, all your debug information and, hopefully either fix it yourself or ask for someone else, more experienced, to fix it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It&amp;#8217;s a very organic process and it become second nature to every non-passive programmer reasonably fast. The important thing is to understand that no good programmer lives in isolation: the internet is a living and breathing world-wide community that you must be a part of, in order to become a respectable and good programmer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    So, you are a beginner programmer. Welcome to the Programming field. There are lots of exciting new things for you to explore and learn. It is even more exciting because it has no defined goal, no finish line, no end at all. You will never get bored because it is ever changing. You can learn at the very least, one new thing every single day.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You can and should socialize with other experienced programmers. Join communities. Read good books. This is a wonderful craft that can be very rewarding once you get yourself really started.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Understand that there is no such thing as a &amp;#8216;perfect software&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;bug free software&amp;#8217;. You will make mistakes, lot&amp;#8217;s of them. And that is okay as far as you recognize them and learn from your mistakes. It is not how many mistakes you make, it is how many of them do you repeat over and over. It is how prepared you are to handle mistakes. There is no such a thing as a &amp;#8216;perfect painting&amp;#8217;. An artist is always tweaking his own skills. That&amp;#8217;s what we do.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Good luck, Paresh.

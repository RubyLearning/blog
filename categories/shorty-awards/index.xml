&lt;p&gt;“Hollywood has the Oscars. Broadway has the Tonys. Now Twitter has
the…Shorty Awards” – The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty Awards&lt;/a&gt; nomination
process has begun! In January 2010, the community is invited to nominate
Twitter users for excellence over the past year. The awards recognize
each content creator’s entire body of work, not just an individual
tweet. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/rules&#34;&gt;Nominations&lt;/a&gt; are made by sending
a tweet, whether it’s through this site or on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/shortyawards.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shorty
Awards&#34; title=&#34;Shorty Awards&#34; /&gt;

In February 2010, the nominees will be narrowed down to five finalists
in each category. Winners will be determined by a combination of popular
vote and by the members of the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://rtacademy.org/&#34;&gt;Real-Time Academy of Short Form Arts
&amp;amp; Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. An awards ceremony, complete with
140-character acceptance speeches, will be held in March 2010 in New
York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shorty Awards are a worldwide effort to engage hundreds of thousands
of Twitter users to identify the best people and organizations on
Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shameless Plug&lt;/strong&gt;: If you feel that RubyLearning is helping in
spreading the knowledge of Ruby programming world-wide, then please do
vote for @IndianGuru in #education at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/IndianGuru&#34;&gt;Shorty Awards
2009&lt;/a&gt;. Every vote counts. &lt;a href=&#34;http://1st.shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;We had
won this category in
2008&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance Ceremony?</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/2009/01/27/will-rubylearning-be-present-at-the-shorty-awards-acceptance-ceremony/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The votes have been cast and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt; have come to an end. The official
results are in, and RubyLearning is a winner of the Shorty Award in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;education category&lt;/a&gt;.
RubyLearning represented by its nearly 7000 participants from over 140
countries are delighted and so am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/satransparent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Winner in Education category at Shorty
Awards&#34; title=&#34;Winner in the Education category at Shorty Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt;, they have been given to “the best
producers of short content in 2008.” And by short content, they mean 140
characters or less. In other words, these are the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/rubylearning&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Rubylearning get as a Shorty Award winner? Aside from &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt;,
apparently a \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/awards-ceremony/&#34;&gt;awards
ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. The award
ceremony will be streamed online, posted to YouTube, and photographed /
videotaped by various media outlets. Additionally, 3 favorite Shorty
Awards nominations or votes tweeted by RubyLearning’s followers will be
projected onto a screen behind me when I (representing RubyLearning)
appear on stage to give a 140 character acceptance speech. In addition,
RubyLearning will receive an awards plaque and a gift bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though RubyLearning won, it only received 275 official votes, and I (for
RubyLearning) shamelessly asked my 1000 or so Twitter followers and 7000
RubyLearning participants to vote for me on several occasions. Only 3.4%
of my own followers thought RubyLearning deserved to win or made the
effort to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McAWilliams in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://verba.mcawilliams.com/archive/the-shorty-awards-final.html&#34;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
says that “*I think the idea of the awards themselves is an excellent
idea but the system has a few flaws*“. I agree. He mentions these flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voting system should not be based on just being a popularity
contest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly people nominate tweeters in what ever category they feel
they should be in – Rubylearning was also nominated in “humor”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of pre-populated tweets where you can provide a simple url
that brings you to your twitter webpage and has a tweet pre-filled
for you, is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance
Ceremony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to be there but some of the reasons I won’t, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn, New York does not cover my
US\$ 1750 (roughly) cost of traveling to New York from Pune, India
where I reside. Shorty Awards probably did not realize that someone
from outside of USA could win in one of their 26 official
categories! &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that “*some
winners from Russia and Australia are attending the award
ceremony*“. I wonder who these twitterers are?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorty Awards gave the winners only 14 days to make their travel
arrangements. The time is too short for international winners, like
me. All the tickets from Mumbai to New York on most airlines are
already booked. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that
“&lt;em&gt;this is the award’s first year, and there are bound to be hiccups.
We’ll take this situation into account for next year, and try to
give winners more time to make travel arrangements to the
ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lighter vein, it’s freezing out there in New York. Pune is a
comfortable 86^o^ F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Shorty Awards should seriously consider is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s giving out \$1,000 travel grants so that winners (the actual
people Twittering) can attend the event, so it can only be used by
winners who actually attend. (Not by proxies or winners who don’t
attend). &lt;strong&gt;This is incorrect. All award ceremonies allow proxies to
collect an award for a winner, in case the winner can’t attend – why
not at Shorty Awards? Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards clarified that “*the
\$1000 is not an ‘award’, it is a ‘travel grant’, and therefore can
only be claimed by winners traveling to the ceremony.*“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a winner can’t be present at the awards ceremony, Shorty Awards
should courier the winners’ awards plaque and gift bag. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
Shorty Awards clarified that “&lt;em&gt;they would mail the award plaque if a
winner could not make it to the awards ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/shorty.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shorty
Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, RubyLearning’s follower count increased dramatically
and many of these people have started to converse with me regularly and
I know will become good net friends! So many new ideas got discussed and
all of this is good for &lt;strong&gt;Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. Even at this late stage, some of my
RubyLearning participants want to start a donation drive to collect
funds so that I can travel to New York – very sweet of them. Friends,
why collect and waste money on my trip to New York. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/415&#34;&gt;do
donate and collect money for
RubyLearning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that I can
continue maintaining the RubyLearning sites and provide quality content
to you. Game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you all so much for voting for RubyLearning. Almost all of
your 140 character ballots expressing why RubyLearning deserved to win
the award were terrific. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@DrGreene: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because he makes learning programming fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@TinaShang: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because…Knowledge is power and he is giving it away
free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@hectorsq: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it really helps to spread Ruby all around the world,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@mjuneja: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it makes Ruby learning fun &amp;amp; easy &amp;amp; makes famous Rubyists
accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@Melindhra: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because it’s the best online learning community I’ve
seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Speech&lt;/strong&gt;: RubyLearning sent a video of its acceptance
speech to Shorty Awards for the 11th Feb. award ceremony in New York.
(Unfortunately, no longer available.)&lt;/p&gt;
